He claims that he was born as Sven Pedersen at Frederiksborg, Zealand, Denmark. He later adopted his mother's maiden name Hassel. At the age of 14 he joined a merchant navy as a cabin boy and worked in ship until his military service in 1936. In 1937, to escape the Great Depression, the unemployed Hassel moved to Germany to join the army. In an interview in 1990, he said, &quot;Germany happened to be closer than England, I went to a Wehrmacht recruiting office to enlist, but it wasn't as easy as I had thought. Only German citizens could serve. After six months of trying to join up, the Seventh Cavalry Regiment finally accepted me on the condition that I became a naturalized German.&quot; Later he served with the second Panzer Division stationed at Eisenach and in 1939 was a tank driver during the invasion of Poland.\n\nA year later he attempted to escape. &quot;. . .I was quite simply exhausted. I did not return to my unit after a short leave. Desertion they called it. I was transferred to a Sonderabteilung, a penal unit manned by criminals and dissidents.&quot;\n\nHe served with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and later the 11th and 27th Panzer Regiments (6th Panzer Division) on all fronts except North Africa and was wounded several times. Eventually he reached the rank of lieutenant and received an Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class. He surrendered to Soviet troops in Berlin in 1945 and spent the following years in various POW camps. He began to write his first book, Legion of the Damned while he was interned.\n\nHe was released in 1949, and was planning to join the French Foreign Legion when he met Dorthe Jensen, whom he married in 1951. He went to work in a car factory, but his wife encouraged him to write about his experiences. De FordÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸mtes Legion (Legion of the Damned) was published in 1953.\n\nIn 1957 Sven Hassel suffered from an attack of a sickness caught during the war and was paralyzed for almost two years. After recovery, he began to write more books. In 1964 he moved to Barcelona, Spain, where, as of 2004, he still lives. In total he has published fourteen novels which have been translated into eighteen languages. In 1987 his book DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸den pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ larvefÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸dder (Wheels of Terror) was made into a film with the title The Misfit Brigade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9120d4a36f48032663a2e5ea8f756153a31aecd6","amp;dn":"Blindatele+Mortii-Sven+Hassel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9120d4a36f48032663a2e5ea8f756153a31aecd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,32,212,163,111,72,3,38,99,162,229,234,143,117,97,83,163,26,236,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
