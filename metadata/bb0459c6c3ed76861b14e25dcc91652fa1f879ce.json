Others create it.\n\nHigh in their mountain covens, red witches pray to the Goddess, protecting the Witchlands by throwing the bones and foretelling the future.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all fake.\n\nAt least, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Ryder thinks. He doubts the witches really deserve their tithesÃ¢â‚¬â€one quarter of all the crops his village can produce. And even if they can predict the future, what danger is there to foretell, now that his peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old enemy, the Baen, has been defeated? \n\nBut when a terrifying new magic threatens both his village and the coven, Ryder must confront the beautiful and silent witch who holds all the secrets. Everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever believed about witches, the Baen, magic, and about himself will change when he discovers that the prophecies heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always scornedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦are about him.\n\nLaced with rich, imagined histories; miles of catacombs; and prophecies true and false, Witchlanders takes place in an evocative, tantalizingly vibrant world and raises equally evocative questions: Who gets to define history? When does a legend become a crutch? And why does the enemy in war look a lot like the hero?\n\nLena CoakleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novel is a lush, chilling story that is sure to send shivers through your finger bones.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Fantasy, Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0459c6c3ed76861b14e25dcc91652fa1f879ce","amp;dn":"Witchlanders+by+Lena+Coakley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0459c6c3ed76861b14e25dcc91652fa1f879ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,4,89,198,195,237,118,134,27,20,226,93,204,145,101,47,161,248,121,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
