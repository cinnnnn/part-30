This makes for a book that is very easy to use and ideal for anyone pressed for time - engineers facing a deadline or students revising an interfacing course module. The mathematics and computer science is provided on a need-to-know basis, making this an essential guide for a wide range of scientists and engineers who want to harness the potential of the PC for data acquisition purposes.\n\nReference sections are supported by project work based round the serial port of a PC, using simple, widely available technology to illustrate key principles and techniques. Concise coverage is also given to the use of the parallel port, USB port and ADC cards. Through the lab work provided the reader is led through the process of constructing a fully functional measurement interfacing system.\n\nTony Fischer-Cripps is a Project Leader in the Division of Telecommunications and Industrial Physics of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research Organisation), Australia.
