Cast FIXED.\n\nI have split the book up into it's chapters.  I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places.  In the original torrent, they were split up into 108 mp3 files, and I broke those mp3 files into smaller ones, one for each chapter.\n\nAs far as I have been able to tell, there hasn't really been anything wrong with these files from the beginning. But, if you find something the matter, just comment and I'll try and fix what is wrong.  I haven't listened to this book yet, and i haven't read it at all yet either so I didn't probe into the original files too closely so if there is anything wrong at all (ticks in the audio, unusually long pauses, anything) just comment and tell me exactly where it is and I will be able to fix it for you and reupload it.\n\n\nI've also made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file.  These are actually smaller in size, and they work perfectly on your iPod.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nNext Up: I know I said that I would do the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy next but it has confused me greatly, so I'm going to do the Artemis Fowl series next instead.\n\nIf you have any requests, email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fd948d9893998f9c9a9293c4c4bd849c959292d39e9290&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and I'll take it into consideration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c17cc128ff4706bc2cff7f581a11ed6d3af083c","amp;dn":"House+of+Night+05+-+Haunted+Audiobook+FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c17cc128ff4706bc2cff7f581a11ed6d3af083c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,23,204,18,143,244,112,107,194,207,247,245,129,161,30,214,211,175,8,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
