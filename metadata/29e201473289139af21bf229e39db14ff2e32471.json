From the hell of Soviet-occupied Afghanistan to the planning of 9/11 and a revolution in Saudi Arabia, this is a tale of war, terror and obsession. The story is told in 2007, as the narrator remembers his 20 years of conflict.\n\nOsama bin Laden is involved throughout the story and, while the period from mid-2003 to 2007 is entirely speculative, chapters detailing the formation and development of Al-Qaeda are accurate and based on extensive research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e201473289139af21bf229e39db14ff2e32471","amp;dn":"The+Death+Of+Osama+Bin+Laden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e201473289139af21bf229e39db14ff2e32471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,226,1,71,50,137,19,154,242,27,242,41,227,157,177,79,242,227,36,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
