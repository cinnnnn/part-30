COULD YOU EVER IMAGINE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AND TO THE COMMUNE HERE?\r\n\r\nANSWER:* I never think of the future, so I am always prepared for everything. I am never surprised, never disappointed either. Whatever happens, I take it for granted that it must do some good.\r\nAnything looked rightly is always beneficial. Whatever happened here has helped my people immensely. Now it will never happen again.\r\nThey were innocent people. The whole life of the commune was only four years. They trusted me absolutely, although I have never asked anybody to trust in me or have faith in me. Just the contrary, I have asked them never to have any belief, any faith. Doubt is my fundamental teaching","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984cace0f556a9706ba476eb5b372a644302985e","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament+Vol-2+%2327_criminals.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984cace0f556a9706ba476eb5b372a644302985e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,76,172,224,245,86,169,112,107,164,118,235,91,55,42,100,67,2,152,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
