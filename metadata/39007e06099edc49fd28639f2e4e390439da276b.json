Both near the beginnings of their careers, Zawinul and Lateef nonetheless dominate this set; two of the original tracks are by Lateef, including the centerpiece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBrother John,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for John Coltrane and featuring an astonishing extended Lateef solo on oboe, an instrument not normally associated with jazz, but which takes on an almost Middle Eastern fluidity and grace in its approximation of ColtraneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsheets of soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ technique.

Often overlooked, this is one of AdderleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest albums.
