The patient, Ramon Silva, refuses to undergo the prescribed treatment, and the team learns that after his daughter's cancer was cured, he pledged an oath of self-sacrifice to God. With little time to save Ramon's life, the team struggles to understand his reasoning and seemingly extreme religious convictions, but eventually learn that faith is not an argument. Meanwhile, Taub questions his wife Rachel about her relationship with an infidelity support group member and the team attends a co-worker's wedding where Wilson's relationship with Sam takes an unexpected turn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5350b8a94794d90a6d9026f34f520b22fcb0c0e4","amp;dn":"House+S07E08++Small+Sacrifices++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5350b8a94794d90a6d9026f34f520b22fcb0c0e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,80,184,169,71,148,217,10,109,144,38,243,79,82,11,34,252,176,192,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
