Doctor! [promo].VOB\n\n\n\nHQ rare promo music video. &quot;Doctor! Doctor!&quot; is a song from Into the Gap, the fourth album by the British pop group Thompson Twins. It was released in February 1984 and reached no.1 on the UK Albums Chart, and no.10 on the U.S. Billboard 200.\n\nAfter the commercial success of Quick Step and Side Kick, the band worked once again with producer Alex Sadkin at his Compass Point studio in the Bahamas.\n\nThe first single to be released was &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;, which reached the no. 4 position in the UK in November 1983. Four other tracks were released from the album in various countries around the world: &quot;Doctor! Doctor!&quot; (UK #3, US #11), &quot;You Take Me Up&quot; (UK #2, US #44), &quot;Sister of Mercy&quot; (UK #11), and &quot;The Gap&quot; (US #69). The first four of these singles all had music videos that were shot to promote them, and the Thompson Twins were a prominent fixture on MTV and other music video outlets of the era.\n\nInto The Gap was the band's biggest selling album, being certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in the US.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Gap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Gap&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAbAiAAdh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAbAiAAdh&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:04:28\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
