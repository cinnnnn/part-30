So what can we know about the real Jesus?\r\n\r\nWriting with thoroughness and clarity, the author explains Bayesâ€™s Theorem in terms that are easily understandable to professional historians and laypeople alike, employing nothing more than well-known primary school math. He then explores precisely how the theorem can be applied to history and addresses numerous challenges to and criticisms of its use in testing or justifying the conclusions that historians make about the important persons and events of the past. The traditional and established methods of historians are analyzed using the theorem, as well as all the major &quot;historicity criteria&quot; employed in the latest quest to establish the historicity of Jesus. The author demonstrates not only the deficiencies of these approaches but also ways to rehabilitate them using Bayesâ€™s Theorem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c79e683e48732925635ab5346264d5579e500f","amp;dn":"Proving+History%3A+Bayes%27s+Theorem+and+the+Quest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c79e683e48732925635ab5346264d5579e500f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,199,158,104,62,72,115,41,37,99,90,181,52,98,100,213,87,158,80,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
