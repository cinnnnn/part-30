The film stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, and Jeff Conaway. It was successful both critically and at the box office; its soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second-best selling album of the year in the United States, behind the soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever, another film starring Travolta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrease - Remastered Deluxe Edition 2003\n\n\nGrease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture is the original motion picture soundtrack for the 1978 film Grease released by Polydor Records and originally by RSO Records. The song &quot;You're the One That I Want&quot; was a US and UK #1 for stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.\n\nThe soundtrack was released in April 1978, two months ahead of the film's release.[1] The cover gives credit to, and prominently features, the two stars of the film - John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John - although they only appear on seven of the 24 tracks. The remainder of the album is sung by various cast members and Sha Na Na - a group who performed many of the 1950s numbers in the film. The title track was recorded by Frankie Valli, who had no other connection with the film.\n\nThe most successful songs from the soundtrack were written specifically for the film. They included the Billboard number-one hits &quot;You're the One That I Want&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot; and the number-three, Academy Award-nominated &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;.[2] In the UK, the album proved even more successful where &quot;You're the One That I Want&quot; reached No.1 for nine weeks, &quot;Summer Nights&quot; reached No.1 for seven weeks, while &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; and &quot;Sandy&quot; all became top three hits.[3][4][5][6] The soundtrack album hit the top of the charts in the U.S. during the summer of 1978, replacing The Rolling Stones' Some Girls. In the UK, it remained at the top of the charts for 13 consecutive weeks.[7]\n\nTwo of the bass players who recorded on the Grease soundtrack were (at different times) members of Toto. One of these, David Hungate, also performed on Olivia Newton-John's album Totally Hot with Toto guitarist Steve Lukather. Other musicians here have previously worked with Elton John, Steely Dan, The Bee-Gees and others.\n\nThe album sold 28 million copies worldwide\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the soundtrack four-and-a-half stars. He stated that &quot;the originals hold up better than the '50s tunes&quot;, but that they &quot;are so giddily enjoyable&quot; &quot;that everything works.&quot; He also said that &quot;the sleek pop production the movie's soundtrack boasts and the cast's enthusiastic performances go a long way in making this Grease the definitive Grease.&quot;\n\n\nThe CD of the soundtrack has been released twice in the US. In April 1991 it was released as a single disc replicating the sequence of the original 1978 LP. In September 2003 it was released by PolyGram as a 2-CD digitally-remastered &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; containing additional tracks. As with the LP and single-disc CD, the songs are not presented in the order replicating their appearances in the movie.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.  \tGrease (03:25)\nFrankie Valli \n2.  \tSummer Nights (03:36)\nJohn Travolta/Olivia Newton-John &amp; Cast \n3.  \tHopelessly Devoted To You (03:05)\nOlivia Newton-John \n4.  \tYou're The One That I want (02:49)\nJohn Travolta/Olivia Newton-John \n5.  \tSandy (02:35)\nJohn Travolta \n6.  \tBeauty School Drop-Out (03:59)\nFrankie Avalon \n7.  \tLook At Me, I'm Sandra Dee (01:40)\nStockard Channing \n8.  \tGreased Lightnin' (03:14)\nJohn Travolta \n9.  \tIt's Raining On Prom Night (02:52)\nCindy Bullens \n10.  \tAlone At The Drive-In Movie (02:25)\n(Instrumental) \n11.  \tBlue Moon (02:23)\nSha-Na-Na \n12.  \tRock'n'Roll Is Here To Stay (02:02)\nSha-Na-Na \n13.  \tThose Magic Changes (02:18)\nSha-Na-Na \n14.  \tHound Dog (01:25)\nSha-Na-Na \n15.  \tBorn To Hand Jive (04:39)\nSha-Na-Na \n16.  \tTears On My Pillow (02:03)\nSha-Na-Na \n17.  \tMooning (02:15)\nLouis-St-Louis &amp; Cindy Bullens \n18.  \tFreddy My Love (02:48)\nCindy Bullens \n19.  \tRock'n'Roll Party Queen (02:11)\nLouis-St-Louis \n20.  \tThere Are Worse Things I Could Do (02:23)\nStockard Channing \n21.  \tLook At Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise) (01:30)\nOlivia Newton-John \n22.  \tWe Go Together (02:59)\nJohn Travolta/Olivia Newton-John &amp; Cast \n23.  \tLove Is A Many Splendored Thing (01:23)\n(Instrumental) \n24.  \tGrease (Reprise) (03:26)\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n1.\t&quot;Grease&quot; (Instrumental version)\n2.\t&quot;Summer Nights&quot; (Sing-a-long version)\n3.\t&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; (Sing-a-long version)\n4.\t&quot;You're the One I Want&quot; (Sing-a-long version)\n5.\t&quot;Sandy&quot; (Sing-a-long version)\n6.\t&quot;Greased Lightnin'&quot; (Single version)\n7.\t&quot;Rydell Fight Song&quot; (Previously unreleased instrumental)\n8.\t&quot;Greased Up and Ready to Go&quot; (Previously unreleased instrumental)\n9.\t&quot;Grease Megamix&quot; (&quot;You're the One That I Want&quot; /&quot;Greased Lightnin'&quot; /&quot;Summer Nights&quot;)\n10.\t&quot;Grease Dream Mix&quot; (&quot;Grease&quot; /&quot;Sandy&quot; /&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;)\n11.\t&quot;Summer Nights&quot; (Martian remix)\n12.\t&quot;You're the One That I Want&quot; (Martian remix)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5789cf0c46117517eeeb879b75d6929c6e17d35","amp;dn":"Grease+-+25th+Anniversary+Deluxe+Edition+2003+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5789cf0c46117517eeeb879b75d6929c6e17d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,120,156,240,196,97,23,81,126,238,184,121,183,93,105,41,198,225,125,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
