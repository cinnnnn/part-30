This was the first attempt to bring hardcore and gabber to a wide audience and the first event organized by ID&amp;T, who would later go on to organize other big dance music events such as Tomorrowland, Mystery Land, and Sensation White, and Black. Later in 1992 they organized the first Thunderdome party, which was simply titled The Thunder Dome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402e4d889cedece6db189050e380f88df9f988a0","amp;dn":"V.A.Thunderdome+X-Sucking+For+Blood+1995+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402e4d889cedece6db189050e380f88df9f988a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,46,77,136,156,237,236,230,219,24,144,80,227,128,248,141,249,249,136,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
