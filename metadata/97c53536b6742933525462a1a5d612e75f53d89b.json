It presents death investigation at the scene and autopsy, providing readers with a broad understanding of forensic pathology and giving them a clear picture of what happens after the examination of the scene.

Death Investigation methodically explains what happens during autopsy to determine cause and manner of death Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ including particulars of blunt force trauma, sharp force injuries, asphyxia, and gunshot wounds Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ and how findings are presented in court.
