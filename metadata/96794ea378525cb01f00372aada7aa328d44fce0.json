It was released on June 18, 2013, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. The album began production in the living room of a loft space at a Paris hotel. During the process, West gathered various artists and close collaborators for production on the album, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, 88-Keys, No ID and Symbolyc One. Yeezus also features vocal guest appearances from Assassin and King L, as well as previous collaborators Justin Vernon, Frank Ocean, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi and Charlie Wilson. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin only 15 days before its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.\n\nFOLLOW ON TWITTER\nFOLLOW ON TUMBLR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ray25th.tumblr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ray25th.tumblr.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96794ea378525cb01f00372aada7aa328d44fce0","amp;dn":"Kanye+West-Yeezus+%28FLAC+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96794ea378525cb01f00372aada7aa328d44fce0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,121,78,163,120,82,92,176,31,0,55,42,173,167,170,50,141,68,252,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
