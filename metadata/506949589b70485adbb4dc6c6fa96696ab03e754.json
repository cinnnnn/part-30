Born in Germany, Thibodeau, who possesses an impressive falsetto, spent his formative years on the East Coast, splitting his time between Boston, Providence, and New York City. He released his first album under the Death Vessel moniker, Stay Close, in 2005, followed by his Sub Pop debut, Nothing Is Precious Enough for Us, in 2008. He has toured with the likes of Low, JosÃƒÂ© GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, and the Books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506949589b70485adbb4dc6c6fa96696ab03e754","amp;dn":"Death+Vessel+-+Island+Intervals+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506949589b70485adbb4dc6c6fa96696ab03e754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,105,73,88,155,112,72,90,219,180,220,108,111,169,102,150,171,3,231,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
