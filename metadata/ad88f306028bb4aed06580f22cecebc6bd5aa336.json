Hence, it is not surprising that science has entered the realm of sports, and, in particular, that computer simulation has become highly relevant in recent years. This is explored in this book by choosing five different sports as examples, demonstrating that computational science and engineering (CSE) can make essential contributions to research on sports topics on both the fundamental level and, eventually, by supporting athletesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad88f306028bb4aed06580f22cecebc6bd5aa336","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+for+Sport+Simulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad88f306028bb4aed06580f22cecebc6bd5aa336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,136,243,6,2,139,180,174,208,101,128,242,44,236,235,198,189,90,163,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
