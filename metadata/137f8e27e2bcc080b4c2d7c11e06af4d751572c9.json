The dynamic meshing of their respective styles is galvanized by their inventive live presentations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ conceptual, theatrical, almost performance art; altogether curious and highly engaging. Cathartic, rejuvenating, and a portrait of two lives, two separate trails of influence, two burgeoning writersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ minds in the ever shifting hip-hop realm. Dense, agile wordplay atop strutting night-drive grooves and subtle flares of funk, soul &amp; Motown.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://itspassalacqua.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://itspassalacqua.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:137f8e27e2bcc080b4c2d7c11e06af4d751572c9","amp;dn":"Passalacqua+-+Passalacqua+EP+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"137f8e27e2bcc080b4c2d7c11e06af4d751572c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,127,142,39,226,188,192,128,180,194,215,193,30,6,175,77,117,21,114,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
