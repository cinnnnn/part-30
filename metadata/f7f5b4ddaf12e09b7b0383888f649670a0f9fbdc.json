It also differs from her other albums in its sparse instrumentation; instead of a full band, Karine is backed only by her brother Steven Polwart on guitar, and on two tracks by Kim Edgar on piano. The final song, &quot;Can't Weld a Body&quot;, listed as a &quot;preview track&quot; on the tracklisting, is the only original song on the album and was composed for the &quot;Ballad of the Big Ships&quot; episode of BBC Radio's 2006 Radio Ballads series.\n\n Track listing\nAll songs Traditional, arranged by Karine Polwart, except &quot;Can't Weld a Body&quot; composed by Polwart.\n\n&quot;Dowie Dens Of Yarrow&quot; - 6:01 \n&quot;Thou Hast Left Me Ever Jamie&quot; - 3:00 \n&quot;Mirk, Mirk Is The Midnight Hour&quot; - 3:55 \n&quot;Birks Of Invermay&quot; - 3:00 \n&quot;Will Ye Go Tae Flanders?&quot; - 3:57 \n&quot;The Learig&quot; - 3:18 \n&quot;The Death Of Queen Jane&quot; - 3:45 \n&quot;The Wife Of Usher's Well&quot; - 6:49 \n&quot;Can't Weld a Body&quot; - 4:04 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f5b4ddaf12e09b7b0383888f649670a0f9fbdc","amp;dn":"Karine+Polwart...Fairest+Floo%5C%27er%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f5b4ddaf12e09b7b0383888f649670a0f9fbdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,245,180,221,175,18,224,155,123,3,131,136,143,100,150,112,160,249,251,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
