(Sakert! is a band where\nI've sung in Swedish. I also have a band where\nI sing in English - Hello Saferide.) We are\nlucky enough to have super sweet listeners in\ndifferent countries and some of them wrote me,\nsaying they were google translating &quot;Facit&quot;\nand babelfishing it and asking their\ngrandfather with Norwegian ancestors for\ntranslation, and it all turned out very weird.\n\n&quot;How sad&quot;, I thought, &quot;that I can't just\ntranslate the songs.&quot;\n\nWhich is when I thought: &quot;Um, why don't I just\ntranslate the songs.&quot;\n\n&quot;What if&quot;, I thought, &quot;I translate them almost\nword by word, and it nearly turns into a third\nlanguage, English words used in a Swedish way?&quot;\n\nSo I did, and we decided to record the songs\nand turn them into an album. During the\nprocess, the translated songs pretty much felt\nlike new to us. Everything seemed different\nwhen sung in another language, and\nproducer/guitar player Henrik Oja found some\nnew sounds for them.\n\nAbout the album, then. Well, &quot;Pa Engelska&quot;\nmostly contains songs from &quot;Facit&quot;, but it\nalso features two tunes from our first album,\nSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤kert!. The songs are about working too hard,\nloving too much, talking too little, growing\nup too slow in the northern parts of Sweden,\nand about fearing your country's politics is\ngoing somewhere where the rich get richer and\nthe poor get poorer. They're about crying at a\nwedding. They feature a lot of sad guitars and\nfolk-ish violins. Every time I go abroad I\nmeet someone who asks me about the famous\nScandinavian melancholia and I guess this\nalbum pretty much embraces that. The songs are\nsimple and sad. In a fun way, hopefully.\n\nSakert! is a project based in Umea, Sweden. On\ntour and on album, we have been: Annika Norlin,\nHenrik Oja, Daniel Berglund, Mats Hammarstrom,\nJakob Nystrom, Lovisa Nystrom, Frida Johansson,\nand some other people who occasionally help\nout.\n\nWe've been nominated to a lot of awards, like\nthe Swedish Grammys, and won a few. We sold a\nlot of albums and we always try to make people\ncry when we play. Um, that's about it.\n\nf\n\nooh ye..\n\n::t r a c k  l i s t  :::\n\n01.
