I called him earlier the opposite\nof Peter BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tzmann, in the sense that his tone is warm and elegant, and that he\ndoes not need to shout or scream in order to be adventurous or move\nboundaries. And his style of playing comes close to the efforts made by Joe\nMcPhee in the previous years, in whose tone anger has been gradually replaced by\ncompassion, though not completely. It's no surprise they met and played\ntogether, assisted by the great Jay Rosen on drums. &quot;Intimate Conversations&quot;,\nthe title of the album, is well-chosen, because that's exactly what this CD\nbrings. The first two tracks are duets between McPhee and Rosen, fierce,\nanguished, powerful. On the third track the tone melts down to more melancholy\nregions for a duet between McPhee and Trzaska. On &quot;Did God Forget About\nDarfur/What God?&quot; the first trio track can be heard. While McPhee sticks to his\ntenor on the whole album, Trzaska alternates between alto, bass clarinet and the\nrarely used C-melody sax. That difference makes it easier to identify the\nmusicians, although their differences in style are easily recognized. The\ninteraction, the common language they find, the call-and-response, are all\nexcellent, especially in &quot;Intimate Conversation # 2&quot; on which they move to the\nhigher registers of the instruments, playing very controlled and shrill tones,\nlike birds. Jay Rosen brings a solo drums tribute piece to Max Roach, called\n&quot;North Star&quot; and although I'm not a real fan of drum solos, this one is\ncaptivating, with some one-handed drum rolls, played with power and subtlety as\nRoach did himself. The most intimate conversation is the third one, on which\nTrzaska brings some rhythmic and hypnotic circular breathing on bass clarinet\nthroughout the track, over which McPhee plays some eery light lines, sparsely\naccompanied by Rosen, moving into a more intense blaze in the middle, yet\nfalling back in their initial routine at the end : a bizarre and impactful piece\nof music. One of the greatest feats of the album is the space the musicians\noffer each other, creating great openness. The best example of this can be found\nin &quot;Snowflakes on flowers&quot;, on which the music expresses exactly that, with all\nthe trembling lightness and softness of touch it entails, including a little\nover 15 seconds when nothing can be heard at all. A great, explorative and\nsensitive album.\n\n\n--\n\n\nBy Lyn Horton &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28296&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28296&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Clifford Allen &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28471&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28471&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8843299218108179e7456dfc62fdf311754d4a93","amp;dn":"Joe+McPhee%2C+Mikolaj+Trzaska%2C+Jay+Rosen+-+Intimate+Conversations+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8843299218108179e7456dfc62fdf311754d4a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,67,41,146,24,16,129,121,231,69,109,252,98,253,243,17,117,77,74,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
