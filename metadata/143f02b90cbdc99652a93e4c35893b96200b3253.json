This is the story of two &amp;#039;scrubbers&amp;#039; from a rough n&amp;#039; ready Bradford estate who quickly become infatuated with their babysitting employer, Bob, who just happens to think he&amp;#039;s God&amp;#039;s gift to women, although his frigid wife certainly does&amp;#039;nt appear to think so. In order to get his leg over after months of living a sexless life, Bob illicitly get&amp;#039;s involved with both babysitters, and gives them a &amp;#039;good drive&amp;#039; home in more ways than one up on the moors. Cue hilarious scenes at the local nighclub, where both girls hot-dance with Bob to Black Lace&amp;#039;s novelty song &amp;#039;We&amp;#039;re Having A Gang Bang&amp;#039; while his wifes friend looks-on disgustedly, and the domestic conflicts between Sue and her constantly pissed-up father, with more f-words on show than the F-section of the New Oxford dictionary. But it&amp;#039;s all scripted within context and is thus very funny. \nThe scene where Bob&amp;#039;s wife confronts him when she find&amp;#039;s out about his infidelity is an absolutely classic, and involves one of the funniest lines in British movie history. The film also has some tragic moments, with Sue getting involved with an Asian woman-beater (a bit over-sterotypical here )while Rita gets up the duff with nowhere to turn, refusing to go back to finish her studies. It is here where we see that Sue is likely to survive the rigours of life (she is the brighter of the two), with Rita likely to struggle through poor choices, no self-confidence and a complete lack of direction.\nOverall, RSABT combines a perfect blend of plot, brilliantly-played northern comedy (and great casting)with a tragic subtext throughout. It also gives us a small insight into Thatcher&amp;#039;s Britain in the mid-1980&amp;#039;s, where the class-divide was getting wider by the day. Highly recommended.\nEnjoy Please Seed.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091859/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091859/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143f02b90cbdc99652a93e4c35893b96200b3253","amp;dn":"Rita%2CSue+And+Bob+Too%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143f02b90cbdc99652a93e4c35893b96200b3253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,63,2,185,12,189,201,150,82,169,62,76,53,137,59,150,32,11,50,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
