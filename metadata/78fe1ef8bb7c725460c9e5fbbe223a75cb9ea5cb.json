So some Super 8 footage from Australia has been edited promo-style to accompany it.\n\nDVD Features:\nMenues \nDVD 1:\n# Live at the Royal Albert Hall (1970)\n# 1969 - 3 titles from Danish Television (31 min Stereo)\n# 1969 - Communication Breakdown Promo - Paris (9 min Stereo)\n# 1969 - Dazed And Confused - Supershow (7 min Stereo)\n\nDVD 2:\n# 1972 - Immigrant Song - Splodge Edit Live (4 min)\n# 1973 - Madison Square Garden - New York (24mn) - 4 titles not included in the film The Song Remains The Same\n# 1975 - Earl's Court - London 49 min - 6 titles\n# 1979 - Knebworth - Angleterre 52 min - 7 titles\n# 1970 - NBC interview with the band (mono)\n# 1972 - Rock N' Roll + interviews from Australian Television (4 min Stereo)\n# 1975 - Interview with Robert Plant - BBC Old Grey Whistle (4 min Stereo)\n# 2 clips : Over The Hills and Travelling Riverside Blues (4 min)\n\nDescription\nTrack lists:\n\nDisc 1\nLive at the Royal Albert Hall (1970) 1hr 42 mins\n01.
