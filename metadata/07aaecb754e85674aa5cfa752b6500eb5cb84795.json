Though he uses a backup band consisting of second guitar, bass, and drums, the majority of the tracks simply feature McDowell unaccompanied, showing off his masterful bottleneck guitar skills. The material here documents a rather transitional period for the artist, as he was using electric instruments and expanding his repertoire to include some traditional songs which he was rediscovering. To be sure, a good deal of the material is of traditional origin, with &quot;Levee Camp Blues,&quot; &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In,&quot; and &quot;Dankin's Farm.&quot; Covering over 75 minutes and 18 tracks, this is a pretty complete picture of where McDowell was in the late '60s.
