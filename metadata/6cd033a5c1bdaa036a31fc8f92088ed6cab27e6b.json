She's returned to her hometown on the Jersey Shore to transform a Victorian fixer-upper into a charming-and profitable-guest house. One small problem: the house is haunted, and the two ghosts insist Alison must find out who killed them.\n\nAn Uninvited Ghost (A Haunted Guesthouse Mystery #2)\nAlison and her resident gumshoe ghost are on their next case when the deceased Scott MacFarlane floats in worried that he accidentally killed a prominent local woman. Turns out she's still alive...that is, of course, until she's murdered-in Alison's house. Now, between the demands of her guests and the arrival of a reality television crew, Alison must find the killer before she sees reality from the other side.\n\nOld Haunts (A Haunted Guesthouse Mystery #3)\nThe ghosts haunting Alison Kerby's Jersey Shore guesthouse are sad. Maxie wants to know who murdered her ex-husband, and Paul pines for his still-living almost-fiancee. The only one who isn't missing her ex is Alison-because The Swine just arrived on her doorstep...\n\nA Wild Ghost Chase (A Haunted Guesthouse Mystery #3.5)\nPhantom PI Paul Harrison from the national bestselling Haunted Guesthouse mysteries returns with a tale of his own in a house full of ghosts, secrets, and spectacular oceanside viewsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nThree years ago in a large Victorian house on the Jersey Shore in the town of Harbor Haven, fledgling private investigator Paul and his client, Maxie Malone, were murdered. Since then, recent divorcee and reluctant ghost whisperer Alison Kerby and her 10-year-old daughter Melissa have moved in and converted the place to a guesthouse, where Maxie and Paul are now checked in for an eternity and ready to solve any case that comes their wayÃ¢â‚¬â€or at least spook the guests (who love it). \n\nAlisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a lot on her plate at the moment, however, so when Paul discovers the three-hundred-year-old ghost of a small boy in the house, he decides not to involve her in the case. The boy, named Eagle of the Sun, says heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s searching for his missing mother. PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy to help Eagle of the Sun find her, though something about the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t add up. But why would a lost little ghost lie?\n\nChance of a Ghost (A Haunted Guesthouse Mystery #4)\nAlison KerbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guesthouse is haunted all year round. Surviving the dead of winter, though? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a spooky proposition. \n\nEven with a blizzard bearing down on New Jersey, Alison can count on at least two guestsÃ¢â‚¬â€Paul and Maxie, the stubborn ghosts who share her shore town inn. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her widowed mother, who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just been seeing ghosts, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been secretly dating one: AlisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father. But when he stands her up three times in a row, somethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong. Is he a lost soulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or a missing apparition? \n\nTheir only lead is an overdramatic spiritÃ¢â‚¬â€stage name Lawrence LaurentzÃ¢â‚¬â€who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take direction well and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk until they find his killer. Alison will reluctantly play the part of PI, but when the clues take a sinister turn, the writing is on the wall: If Alison canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep a level head, this will be her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final actÃ¢â‚¬â€and maybe her own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd033a5c1bdaa036a31fc8f92088ed6cab27e6b","amp;dn":"The+Haunted+Guest+House+Mystery+Series+-+E.J.+Copperman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd033a5c1bdaa036a31fc8f92088ed6cab27e6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,208,51,165,193,189,170,3,106,49,252,143,146,8,142,214,202,178,126,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
