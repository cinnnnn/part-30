Schow and John Shirley, and starring Brandon Lee in his final film appearance. \n\nBased on James O'Barr's 1989 comic book of the same name, it tells the story of Eric Draven (Lee), a rock musician who is revived from the dead to avenge his murder and that of his fiancÃƒÂ©e.\n\nLee was accidentally killed during filming. Unfinished scenes that were to feature him were dealt with by rewrites and digital special effects. The Crow was dedicated to him and his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Eliza.\n\nThe film opened at the top of the box office and was a critical and commercial success. It also achieved a strong cult status.\n\nOn the news of future remakes, O'Barr stated, &quot;I don't have great expectations. I think the reality is, no matter who you get to star in it, or if you get Ridley Scott to direct it and spend 200 million dollars, you're still not gonna top what Brandon Lee and Alex Proyas did in that first ten million dollar movie.&quot;\n\n\nAudio 1: original english track\n\nAudio 2: commentary by Jeff Most (producer and executive music producer of the Crow movies) and John Shirley (co-writer of The Crow)\n\nSubtitle track: English SDH\n\n\nJust to make things easier for all fans of this awesome movie, I removed all those crazy russian dubbings (or voice-over translation, whatever) from the other 1080p release here on TPB.\n\n\nPlease keep sharing it for as long as you can. \n\nFeel free to leave a comment anytime. \n\nIf you enjoyed the movie, buy the Blu-ray. It costs only $5.99 at Amazon and the quality is obviously way much better than this compressed file.\n\nThe James O'Barr's graphic novel from which the movie was adapted is pretty cool too. Fans of the movie will not be disappointed.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ca497cac944587540d6051bf7abdddfdde6d2d","amp;dn":"The.Crow.1994.1080p.Bluray.DTS.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ca497cac944587540d6051bf7abdddfdde6d2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,202,73,124,172,148,69,135,84,13,96,81,191,122,189,221,253,222,109,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
