By turns gleaming and filthy, tender and bloody, the film is a visually stunning epic which is never less than compelling. Nigel Terry is perfectly cast as Arthur, whose unwavering trust and faith are shown to be both quietly heroic and achingly naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve. Interestingly, the quest for the Grail is the least effective part of the film, despite bold cinematography by Alex Thomson (who was nominated for an Oscar) and a fine performance by Paul Geoffrey as Perceval, whose greatest desire is attained in his dying sight. It is the scenes of Camelot in which Boorman is at his most effective, as Arthur is betrayed by the burning passions of Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) and Lancelot (Nicholas Clay), whose boiling internal forces cannot be denied, whatever the cost. The wicked Mordred (Robert Addie) and Morgana (Helen Mirren) are commanding when onscreen, and Nicol Williamson's performance as the grandiosely self-sacrificing Merlin is outstanding. Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart also appear in this dense, passionate, and stirring triumph featuring a marvelous Trevor Jones score. The gruesome effects by Peter Hutchinson and Alan Whibley, however, and sights such as a knight having sex in full body armor make this a fairy tale strictly for adults. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082348/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082348/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:14:58\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 592x336 16:9\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1324 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c16ccd473e053f2048ddc6a1c11f33dba51280","amp;dn":"Excalibur+%281981%29+Nigel+Terry+Eng-multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c16ccd473e053f2048ddc6a1c11f33dba51280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,193,108,205,71,62,5,63,32,72,221,198,161,193,31,51,219,165,18,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
