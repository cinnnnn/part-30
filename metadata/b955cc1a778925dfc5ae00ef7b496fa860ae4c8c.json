Thanks man, appreciate it!\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;With this book, China Galland brought increased attention to the spiritual traditions of the Black Madonna and other cross-cultural expressions of the feminine divine. The popularity of recent works by authors like Sue Monk Kidd and Kathleen Norris have only increased readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fascination. Now with a new introduction by the author, Longing for Darkness explores GallandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spellbinding and deeply personal journey from New Mexico through Nepal, India, Switzerland, France, the former Yugoslavia, and PolandÃ¢â‚¬â€places where such figures as Tara, the female Buddha of the Tibetan tradition, and the Black Madonna are venerated today.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;An alcoholic single mother of three, Texas-born Galland ( Women in the Wilderness ) was raised a strict Roman Catholic, turned to Zen Buddhism, then became obsessed with Tara, the female Buddha of Tibetan tradition, and her counterpart, Kali, the black Hindu goddess, death-dealer and life-giver. In black images of divinity the author sought a touchstone for transformation, an avenue to the unconscious. In a baroque church in Switzerland she observed the Black Madonna, a virgin painted coal-black who holds a black Christ Child in her arms. In India she discussed women lamas with Tibet's Dalai Lama in exile. Her 1987 trip to Poland turned up another Black Madonna but also exposed her to a different kind of darkness: secret police, racism, Auschwitz. Blending travelogue, free-floating meditation, autobiography and adventure, her intensely personal narrative is a disquieting spiritual odyssey.&quot; -Publisher's Weekly\n\nThis torrent contains the original EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
