Studies have shown how major\npsychological aspects, such as alertness, complex mental\nperformance, and memory, are strongly affected by sleep deprivation.\nMilitary use of psycbostimulants dates back many\nyears, especially in units that operate over long hours and\ndeprive soldiers of sleep. During prolonged military operations,\npilots are regulariy kept awake for hours and days without\nfulfilling their biological sleep requirements. This consequently\naffects their natural circadian rhythm. This article\ndeals with both the benefits and the side effects of two kinds\nof psychostimulants. namely, dextroamphetamine. which is\nmore popular and is most widely used, and modafinil. which is\na relatively newer type. There is growing evidence that modafinil\nhas fewer side effects, in comparison with its predecessor\ndextroamphetamine. while still maintaining all of the latter&amp;#039;s\nbeneficiai characteristics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17af8381aef156d7a4cc39d57ec9417ff55731d8","amp;dn":"Psychostimulants+and+Military+Operations.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17af8381aef156d7a4cc39d57ec9417ff55731d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,175,131,129,174,241,86,215,164,204,57,213,126,201,65,127,245,87,49,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
