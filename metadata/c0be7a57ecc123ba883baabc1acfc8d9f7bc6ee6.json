It can persuade us to buy something, or remind us of our first date. It can lift us out of depression when nothing else can. It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does -- humans are a musical species.\n\nOliver Sacks's compassionate, compelling tales of people struggling to adapt to different neurological conditions have fundamentally changed the way we think of our own brains, and of the human experience. In Musicophilia, he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians, and everyday people. He explores how catchy tunes can subject us to hours of mental replay, and how a surprising number of people acquire nonstop musical hallucinations that assault them night and day. Yet far more frequently, music goes right: Sacks describes how music can animate people with Parkinson's disease who cannot otherwise speak, and calm and organize people whose memories are ravaged by Alzheimer's or amnesia.\n\nMusic is irresistible, haunting, and unforgettable, and in Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells us why.\n\n6 hours. 64 kbps mono Ogg Vorbis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0be7a57ecc123ba883baabc1acfc8d9f7bc6ee6","amp;dn":"Musicophilia+-+Tales+of+Music+and+the+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0be7a57ecc123ba883baabc1acfc8d9f7bc6ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,190,122,87,236,193,35,186,136,59,170,188,26,207,200,217,247,188,110,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
