The New Portuguese Table takes you on a culinary journey into the soul of this fascinating nation and looks at its 11 surprisingly different historical regions, as well as the island of Madeira and the Azores, and their food culture, typical dishes, and wines. This book also showcases Portugal's pantry of go-to ingredients, such as smoked sausages, peppers, cilantro, seafood, olive oil, garlic, beans, tomatoes, and bay leavesâ€”all beloved by Americans and now combined in innovative ways.\r\nIn The New Portuguese Table, David Leite provides a contemporary look at the flavorful food of this gastronomic region, sharing both the beloved classics he remembers from cooking at his grandmotherâ€™s side, such as Slowly Simmered White Beans and Sausage, as well as modern dishes defining the country today, like Olive Oilâ€“Poached Fresh Cod with Roasted Tomato Sauce.
