Created by Ubisoft and based on the Rayman adventure game series, the show was originally in French but was dubbed into various languages for foreign countries. Ubisoft was able to produce only four episodes and never managed to broadcast its episodes in the United States.\n\nLacMac is the star of a galactic circus, run by Rigatoni and Admiral Razorbeard. He and his friends are forced to live life as circus freaks, only to be hit by whips, and generally tortured. They only wish they can be free from their dreadful unfair lives. One night, after LacMac has just done a great performance, the circus closes for the night and Rigatoni picks up a new circus recruit, Rayman. Rayman is forced to stay at the circus because he can do amazing trick with his floating limbless hands. He discovers that the other performers are forced to stay in this prison when they haven't done anything bad. Rayman won't take this. That night, he helps them escape. Rigatoni hires the bumbling detective, Inspector Grub, to bring the &quot;fugitives&quot; back. Rayman leads the circus freaks in outsmarting Grub and living in the city of Aerotropolis, on the populated world the traveling circus landed.\n\nEpisode list is in the download","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b1e4fb23fd5558b94cb956ec973d9e23534b1c","amp;dn":"Rayman+The+Animated+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b1e4fb23fd5558b94cb956ec973d9e23534b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,177,228,251,35,253,85,88,185,76,185,86,236,151,61,158,35,83,75,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
