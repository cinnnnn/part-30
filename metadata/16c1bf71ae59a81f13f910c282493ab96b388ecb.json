Well, if you took all the good parts of 311 and added some soul-influenced vocals, At The Drive-In-esque guitars, fusion-y keyboards, and a female vocalist that could put most pop singers to shame, you might be getting somewhere near what Eclectic Collective is.  But you wouldn?t quite be there yet.  Their sound is difficult to describe without getting overly bogged down in long sentences containing various musical genres and their many permutations.  But they are definitely Eclectic.  And they are definitely a Collective, their membership numbering close to the double digits.  And they are awesome.  \n\n\nSimilar Artists:\n\nGym Class Heroes, At The Drive-In, 311, John Legend, Jill Scott, RX Bandits, Mute Math, Deftones, Brand New, GlassJAw, Fishbone, Radiohead, Irepress, The Receiving End of Sirens\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c1bf71ae59a81f13f910c282493ab96b388ecb","amp;dn":"The+Eclectic+Collective+-+The+Flux+-+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c1bf71ae59a81f13f910c282493ab96b388ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,193,191,113,174,89,168,31,19,249,16,194,130,73,58,185,107,56,142,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
