But for Jackson Hart things are about to get a whole lot worse. When her best friend, Tye, disappears hunting for food, kick-ass JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhead south to safetyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plan looks like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dead before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even begun. But then she meets ex-mechanic Luke Granger, who takes her to his bunker, feeds her with non-rat based food, and offers her protection against the zombie hordesÃ¢â‚¬â€not that she needs it. She knows how to use a machete and isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to.\n\nJackson was tempted to stay in the city with her rescuer. Food, shampoo and the possibility of finally getting laid, what more could she ask for? But the flesh eaters are getting smarter and the bunker is compromised, so Jackson and Luke have no choice but to make the journey south.\n\nLuke and Jackson team up to find other humans in a road-trip romance for the ages. They travel for thousands of miles with zombies shadowing their every move. They must utilize every resource at their disposalÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and then some. On the way, they discover that even if flesh eating zombies are knocking down their door, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always time for sex and even love.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5807d654985a1b7e359dcbc973f5c39b0a4842d","amp;dn":"Emma+Shortt%2C+Waking+Up+Dead+epub+mobi+dovah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5807d654985a1b7e359dcbc973f5c39b0a4842d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,128,125,101,73,133,161,183,227,89,220,188,151,63,92,57,176,164,132,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
