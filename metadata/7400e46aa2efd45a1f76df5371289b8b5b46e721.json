The chapters describe research and practice from diverse fields of positive psychology, covering topics such as happiness and well-being, motivation and goals, personality, academic performance and coping, measurement and interventions. The book emphasizes a cultural approach to the human pursuit of well-being. It is unique in that it presents research from a range of cultures, such as Russia, Croatia, and Egypt, in addition to ten different Western cultures. This approach helps broaden our understanding of those aspects of human experience that make life worth living in diverse cultural conditions.\nThe book includes well-known and new authors from the field and contains selected papers that were presented at the 4th European Conference of Positive Psychology held in 2008 in Croatia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7400e46aa2efd45a1f76df5371289b8b5b46e721","amp;dn":"The+Human+Pursuit+of+Well-Being+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7400e46aa2efd45a1f76df5371289b8b5b46e721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,0,228,106,162,239,212,90,31,118,223,83,113,40,155,139,91,70,231,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
