Years later, new evidence appears and the cops are back on the trail to solve the murders. The four - now the owner of a failing lumber company (Colm Feore), a priest (Arliss Howard), a policeman (Tony Goldwyn), and a lawyer (David Paymer) - gather in a remote cabin to discuss what their future actions should be. Told in harrowing flashbacks and with obvious difference of current points-of-view, the men argue out their circumstances.\n\nVideo:\nAVC1 x264 mp4\n720x536\n4:3\n800kb/s\n\nAudio:\nmp3\n2 channel Stereo\n48kHz\n65kb/s\n\nSEEDERS NEEDED to keep this torrent alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4038f1891505c7c8cadda3c48bcefd93481f71ae","amp;dn":"The+Lesser+Evil+%281998%29+mp4+Lifetime+Rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4038f1891505c7c8cadda3c48bcefd93481f71ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,56,241,137,21,5,199,200,202,221,163,196,139,206,253,147,72,31,113,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
