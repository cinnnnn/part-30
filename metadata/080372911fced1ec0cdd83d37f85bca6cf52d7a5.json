This book teaches you the features and functiona-lity of PHP5, from installing and configuring it to designing and constructing complex data-driven Web sites.\nAs you proceed, you will build a number of fully functional applications. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be introduced to basic programming logic, relational databases, OOP, PEAR, GTK, MSI, CLI, SQLite, and more. When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re finished, you will understand how to create, test, debug, and put your applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080372911fced1ec0cdd83d37f85bca6cf52d7a5","amp;dn":"Wrox+Press+-+Beginning+PHP5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080372911fced1ec0cdd83d37f85bca6cf52d7a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,3,114,145,31,206,209,236,12,221,131,211,127,133,188,166,207,82,215,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
