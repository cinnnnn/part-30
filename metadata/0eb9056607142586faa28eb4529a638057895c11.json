The 'Ultra Heat Treated EP' seals his position within the post-dilla meets IDM zone inhabited by a range of cats from Illum Sphere to Ikonika, but at once places him on his own little asteroid, zapping discordant electro-soul vibes over fractured hiphop rhythms. The title track renders a cacophany of synths over crushed hiphop rhythms, before the fractal 8-bit bounce of 'Skyfire' and the Joker-on-Ket effect of 'Pressure'. 'Quantum Leap' bashes Nintendo rhythms like a psychotic Quarta 330 and 'Pressure' boils noisy synthetic excesses to freak the IDM heads.\n\nFrom http://boomkat.com/vinyl/263944-slugabed-ultra-heat-treated-ep\n\n-------------\n\n1.
