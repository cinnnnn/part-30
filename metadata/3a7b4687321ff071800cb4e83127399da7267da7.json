Former bandmate J.T. Daly joined the effort, followed one month later by the arrival of another former bandmate, Andy Smith, who added vocals, guitar, harmonica, and synthesizer to the mix. Following some further contributions, the trio soon completed enough material for an EP, which was issued in August 2006 though Drama Club Records. Faced with the challenge of translating their sound to the stage, Paper Route enlisted the help of drummer Gavin McDonald, who joined in time for the creation of the band's debut album, Absence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7b4687321ff071800cb4e83127399da7267da7","amp;dn":"Paper+Route+-+The+Peace+of+Wild+Things+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7b4687321ff071800cb4e83127399da7267da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,123,70,135,50,31,240,113,128,12,180,232,49,39,57,157,167,38,125,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
