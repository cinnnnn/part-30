With a primary focus on the setting, a ramshackle Tofolar village deep within Russia's Sayan mountains, the film contains minimal dialogue, and very little obvious narrative, preferring instead to focus on natural sounds to draw the audience completely into a seldom seen world where nature is so beautifully ruthless that hope for the people can be found not through conversation, but through the humblest physical pleasures. The impoverished village is so remote and so high up that the only transportation comes from horses, domesticated elk and a single tank. A helicopter suddenly appears and delivers a young woman. Her reasons for visiting the snow-covered town are never explained. An old man invites her to his home and she sits within it broodingly smoking a cigarette. He does the same. Neither moves much. Little is said, and neither looks particularly happy about life. The rest of the villagers seem much the same. They day slowly progresses and as the vodka comes out, a grim fiesta begins. The guests get increasingly drunk while an accordion player performs melancholy songs. Two very inebriated, nearly unconscious young men provide the film's only real action when they suddenly attempt to rape the woman. She quickly pulls out a knife. A dead body is seen in the next shot, but it is never clear who killed him. Before the story ends, another killing will occur, but only after a chase. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Few of Us.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 667 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1 529 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 496 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.188\n      Stream size : 1 024 MiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 85.7 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116300/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116300/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSharunas Bartas - Few of Us (1996)\n\nNo language, only local sounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6887f8ecc552b848c34a44d9da3352c2ceb972b","amp;dn":"Sharunas+Bartas+-+Few+of+Us+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6887f8ecc552b848c34a44d9da3352c2ceb972b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,136,127,142,204,85,43,132,140,52,164,77,157,163,53,44,44,235,151,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
