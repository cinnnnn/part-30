Latin bumps as hard as prior albums, but now stripped down to only one drummer, Matt Schulz from Enon, the quartet has a larger tendency to break free of locked motorik rhythms and experiment with massive dynamic shifts and intense swells. This is soundtrack-primed music that does for electronic soundscaping what bands like Explosions in the Sky and Pelican did for metal. Although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primarily instrumental (with the occasional buried vocal), the sum of the parts are so masterfully layered that the listening experience can become spellbinding -- while, on the other hand, it makes for some nice background reading music as well. Latin plays best in its entirety, but specific tracks stand out. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLuckyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a touch of Brian Eno circa-Zooropa flavor, with a steady bassline, a pedal-mangled guitar, and a cracking drum-beat that masks a distant, muffled, sing-along falsetto; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStay LitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ blends Rhodes keys with glitched synth blips before crescendoing into a sea of horns and drum bashing; and &quot;SHT MTN&quot; takes a cowbell beat and steadily grinds it into sandpapery bits of feedback and fuzz, accented by girlish shouts through in an echo chamber. For Holy Fuck, Latin is a monumental step forward. By trimming back the choppy art-house disjointedness and quirky Casio tones, the band has successfully evolved their sound into something much more provocative, heavy duty, and rewarding.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/latin-r1783727/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/latin-r1783727/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01. 1MD\n02.
