Smartly aligning herself with a number of soul legends on her early records, Stone earned a devoted audience at home and abroad, first for her reinterpretations of classic soul songs (as heard on The Soul Sessions) and then, on future albums, for her songwriting chops and powerful delivery. \n\nGenre................: R&amp;B/Soul/Reggae\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Stone'd Records\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n01.Love Me\n02.This Ain't Love\n03.Stuck On You\n04.Star\n05.Let Me Breathe\n06.Cut The Line\n07.Wake Up\n08.Way Oh\n09.Underworld\n10.Molly Town\n11.Sensimilla\n12.Harry's Symphony\n13.Clean Water\n14.The Answer\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba354c96829255084f6de37d2e61afff4911b6e","amp;dn":"Joss+Stone+-+Water+For+Your+Soul+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba354c96829255084f6de37d2e61afff4911b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,163,84,201,104,41,37,80,132,246,222,55,210,230,26,255,244,145,27,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
