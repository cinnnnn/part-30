His life and work serve as a reminder that yoga is not an esoteric discipline from an outdated past but a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.\nIn a series of intriguing discourses and answers to a variety of life-relevant questions. &quot;In the Presence of the Master&quot; offers glimpses of Sadhguru&amp;#039;s profound wisdom.\n\nIn this volume, A Dimension Beyond the Physical Sadhguru sheds light on the conflict within a human being between the compulsions and limitations of body, mind and emotions, and the longing to go beyond. Deeply rooted in the spiritual dimension, but equally versed in worldly matters, Sadhguru aptly enters into seeker&amp;#039;s questions of any kind - from the essentials of the spiritual quest, to past-life memories, homosexuality, and energy healing systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e8dae9a4b9325af46375f0523b4c2e2abd4b2b","amp;dn":"A+Dimension+Beyond+the+Physical+--Sadhguru+Jaggi+Vasudev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e8dae9a4b9325af46375f0523b4c2e2abd4b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,232,218,233,164,185,50,90,244,99,117,240,82,59,76,46,42,189,75,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
