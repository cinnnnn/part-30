Tempos, accents, phrasing are excellent and playing of BPO strings are the best. The performance is an inspired one. Also the performance of Serenata Noturna KV 239 is lustrous too. \n\nAs regards Eine Kleine Nachtmusic KV 525 the performance is interesting especially in the final movement where at the coda the conductor accents a counterpoint which for an instant turns this music to a darker side reminding us of the Don Giovanni finale. \n\nAmong the recordings to compete with the above I can mention Ton Koopman's recording of KV 136-138 on period instruments (Erato) and another later Karajan recording of KV 525 (Polygram).\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1bbf181ce1fb603c16520b5a6a138dfa228288a","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Eine+kleine+Nachtmusik%2C+Divertimenti+K+136%2C+137+%26+138","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1bbf181ce1fb603c16520b5a6a138dfa228288a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,187,241,129,206,31,182,3,193,101,32,181,166,161,56,223,162,40,40,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
