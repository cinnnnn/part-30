His T-shirt read Nietzsche Is My Homeboy.\n\nSo, that was Matt. Who Julie Seagle likes. A lot. But there is also Finn. Who she flat out loves.\n\nComplicated? Awkward? Completely.\n\nBut really, how was this freshly-minted Boston transplant and newbie college freshman supposed to know that she would end up living with the family of an old friend of her mother's? This was all supposed to be temporary. Julie wasn't supposed to be important to the Watkins family, or to fall in love with one of the brothers. Especially the one she's never quite met. But what does that really matter? Finn gets her, like no one ever has before. They have connection.\n\nBut here's the thing about love, in all its twisty, bumpy permutationsÃ¢â‚¬â€it always throws you a few curves. And no one ever escapes unscathed.\n\nNew York Times Best-selling author Jessica Park mines the territory of loveÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growing pains with wit, sharp insights, and a discernible heat and heartbeat. Her previous novels include Relatively Famous and she authored the e-shorts What the Kid Says (Parts 1 and 2) andRick Springfield.\n\nFlat-Out Matt (Flat-Out Love #1.5) by Jessica Park (March 25th 2013)\n\nMatt is a junior at MIT. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s geeky, he's witty, he's brilliant.\n\nAnd heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also very, very stupid.\n\nWhen beautiful, cool, insightful Julie moves in with MattÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family, why (oh why!) does he pretend to be his absent brother Finn for her alleged benefit?\n\nIt seems harmless enough until her short-term stay becomes permanent. And until it snowballs into heart-squeezing insanity. And until he falls in love with Julie, and Julie falls in love with Finn.\n\nBut Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Matt is the right one for her. If only he can make Julie see it. Without telling her the truth, without shattering them all. Particularly his fragile sister Celeste, who may need Julie the most.\n\nYou saw Matt through JulieÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes in FLAT-OUT LOVE. Now go deeper into MattÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world in this FLAT-OUT MATT novella. Live his side of the story, break when his heart breaks, and fall for the unlikely hero all over again.\n\nTake an emotional skydive for two prequel chapters and seven Flat-Out Love chapters retold from his perspective, and then land with a brand-new steamy finale chapter from Julie.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be48f3dbe7cdd949a0355182ded046a31b8c27d7","amp;dn":"Flat-Out+Love+Series+%281-1.5%29+by+Jessica+Park+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be48f3dbe7cdd949a0355182ded046a31b8c27d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,72,243,219,231,205,217,73,160,53,81,130,222,208,70,163,27,140,39,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
