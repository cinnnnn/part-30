The Fixx are an English rock band best known for their song &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot;, from their most successful album Reach the Beach in 1983. The band achieved its greatest success in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Fixx are recording their 10th studio album &quot;Something Ahead of You&quot; due for release in April 2011.\n\n&quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot; is a song by new wave rock group The Fixx, from their album Reach the Beach. &quot;One Thing Leads to Another&quot; is the group's best known song, and their most successful single, peaking at No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and peaking at No. 2 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nReach the Beach is the second studio album by British new wave band The Fixx, released in 1983. The album reached number eight on the American albums chart, their highest to date there.\n\nThis video begins at a science lab where Adam Woods is looking into a microscope observing a new dimension (the wrist shackle in the video on the wall is seen on the cover of Reach the Beach). It shows a dimension in a black tunnel with lights on top where Cy Curnin is dancing in a classy uniform. He is then in a bright tube, wearing a gray shirt with his arms bare. Then, in a blue tunnel, he is running with a dog. It ends with the tunnel in a 3-dimensional angle to see through out the tube.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thing_Leads_to_Another&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thing_Leads_to_Another&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_the_Beach&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_the_Beach&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GABeDaADI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GABeDaADI&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video  : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9000kbps\n   Audio 1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Audio 2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:13\n\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources* (there's a delay that happens while the audio is switching between the two sources)\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
