But when he accidentally drops his favorite smoking pipe into the lower levels of his home, his search for the pipe eventually makes him relive scenes from his eventful life.&quot;--IMDB \r\n\r\n2008 Academy Award winner for short animated films.\r\n\r\nThis is an upload of a video I downloaded. The mkv video was not supported by my Samsung tv's media player even though it supports mkv files. To fix the error in the file I ran it through AVC Ultimate, retaining the original settings, but changing the aspect ratio to 16:9. The original did not fill the screen horizontally or vertically. The conversion retains the original size, 704x480, so there should be no noticeable distortion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de85b0b71d156057e4067155de5585694c99859e","amp;dn":"La+Maison+en+Petits+Cubes+%28The+House+of+Small+Cubes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de85b0b71d156057e4067155de5585694c99859e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,133,176,183,29,21,96,87,228,6,113,85,222,85,133,105,76,153,133,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
