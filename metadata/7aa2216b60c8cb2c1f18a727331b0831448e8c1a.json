And of course, Bagge's well-researched comic strip Ã¢â‚¬Å“essaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ crackle with the same energy and wit that propelled him into the collective Gen X consciousness with his comic book series Hate.\n\nFavorite topics include the erosion of our civil liberties (whether the post-9/11 Bush administration's gradual erosion of the Bill of Rights, the insanity of the war on drugs, or nanny-state meddling), ongoing boondoggles of the American public (for professional sports stadiums or ineffective public transportation systems), the Iraq war (Bagge is vociferously against it), so-called art and so-called entertainment, the homeless, the mall-ification of America, politicians both in general and in particular (including the 2008 presidential race and a revelatory one-on-one with Republican not-so-hopeful Ron Paul that soured Bagge on the candidate forever), the conservative/religious war on sex and drugs, and whether citizens should be allowed to own bazookas. Each piece features the voluble Bagge himself front and center as the puzzled, indignant, or deeply conflicted everyman-on-the-street trying to make sense of this 21st Century.\n\nAnd of course, every panel is delineated in BaggeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glorious, laugh-out-loud stretchy 4-color cartoon style, making even his disquisitions on some very serious topics go down as smoothly as Buddy BradleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest escapade. Nominated for a 2010 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award (Best Humor Publication).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa2216b60c8cb2c1f18a727331b0831448e8c1a","amp;dn":"Peter+Bagge+-+Everybody+Is+Stupid+Except+for+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa2216b60c8cb2c1f18a727331b0831448e8c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,162,33,107,96,200,203,44,31,24,167,39,51,27,8,49,68,142,140,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
