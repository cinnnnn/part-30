He may look like an average guy, now in his mid-40s, but then he opens his mouth and his majestic baritone voice immediately conjures fond memories of such Crash Test Dummies hits at Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm and Superman. Perhaps best remembered for the acerbic folk rock sound of 1991 s The Ghosts That Haunt Me and 1993 s God Shuffled His Feet, there have nonetheless been enough hits for the band over the years to merit a couple of greatest hits packages. Through it all, the band with Roberts at the helm has touched on funk and soul, folk, electronic music and even Christmas tunes. Yet it is Roberts voice and offbeat lyrical sensibility that have been this beloved band s calling cards since their founding twenty years ago.\n\nDue for release on May 11, Oooh La La (Deep Fried) is again something of a different animal for the Crash Test Dummies. This time Roberts collaborates with producer/engineer Stewart Lerman, whose many credits include such divergent talents as Antony and the Johnsons and The Roches, as well as filmmakers like Wes Anderson and Martin Scorcese. While longtime CTD member Ellen Reid added back-up vocals and a lead on the closing acoustic ballad Put a Face, this album is fundamentally the work of these two creative men. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbedbf4ada6d2063768fe43254a7653c3246ca34","amp;dn":"Crash+Test+Dummies+-+Oooh+La+La+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbedbf4ada6d2063768fe43254a7653c3246ca34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,237,191,74,218,109,32,99,118,143,228,50,84,167,101,60,50,70,202,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
