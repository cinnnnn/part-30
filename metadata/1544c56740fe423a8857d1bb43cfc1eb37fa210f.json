In order to keep the masses down, Tekken sponsors the Iron Fist Tournament in which fighters compete to the death for ultimate glory and receive a lifetime of stardom and wealth. We are introduced to this violent world through the eyes of Jin Kazama, a street fighter that enters the tournament in order to avenge the death of his mother that he blames upon TekkenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful and controlling Chairman, Heihachi Mishima. He knows that the only way to get close enough to Mishima to kill him is to win the tournament. With the help of Lucas, an ageing Iron Fist Champion and fight trainer, Jin makes his way through the tournament, but in doing so, he begins to uncover his own past and inner demons as well as exposing a dark underbelly to Tekken that threatens the very existence of humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1544c56740fe423a8857d1bb43cfc1eb37fa210f","amp;dn":"Tekken.2010.DVDRip.XviD.kRi83","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1544c56740fe423a8857d1bb43cfc1eb37fa210f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,68,197,103,64,254,66,58,136,87,209,187,67,207,193,235,55,250,33,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
