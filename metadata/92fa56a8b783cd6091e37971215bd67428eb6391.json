We're counting down the biggest hits in the nation the way they're ranked on Billboard Magazine's Pop Singles chart and our countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nAfter ten weeks in the top 10, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; by Donna Summer slips to number 11.\n\nCasey tells us why the man who told Beethoven to &quot;Roll Over&quot; and Johnny to &quot;B. Goode&quot; is in jail.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What solo artist has had the most top ten hits without ever hitting number one?&quot;\n\nThere's an artist in the countdown whose career almost ended in one of the greatest promotional fiascos of rock history. The group he was in at the time became the laughing stock of the music industry. Casey tells the story.\n\nCasey lists 27 acts that are named after food (such as Meatloaf or The Lemon Pipers).\n\nThere's a group in the countdown whose early adventures sound like a television sit-com. On their first trip to New York City, they lose all their musical instruments, push their host out of his own home, then borrow his car and wreck it. Casey gives the details.\nLW#3: The Main Event/Fight - Barbra Streisand\nLW#2: Good Times - Chic\nLW#1: My Sharona - The Knack\n40:    Youngblood - Rickie Lee Jones\n39:    Hold On - Triumph\n38:    Saturday Night - Herman Brood &amp; His Wild Romance        \n37:    Girl Of My Dreams - Brian Tchaikovsky     \n36:    What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin' - Stephanie Mills     \nLDD: Tragedy - The Bee Gees\n35:    Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough - Michael Jackson    \nARCHIVES: My Eyes Adored You - Frankie Valli\n34:    You Can't Change That - Raydio\n33:    Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' - Journey\n32:    The Boss - Diana Ross\n31:    Pop Muzik - M\n30:    Oh Well - The Rockets\n29:    Ring My Bell - Anita Ward    \n28:    Different Worlds - Maureen McGovern\n27:    Cruel To Be Kind - Nick Lowe\n26:    Highway Song - Blackfoot\n25:    Born To Be Alive - Patrick Hernandez\n24:    Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra\n23:    I Do Love You - G.Q.\n22:    Drivers Seat - Sniff &amp; The Tears\n21:    Bad Case Of Loving You - Robert Palmer\n20:    Heaven Must Have Sent You - Bonnie Pointer\n19:    Rise - Herb Alpert\n18:    Hot Summer Nights - Night\nLDD: You And Me Against The World - Helen Reddy\n17:    When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman - Dr. Hook\n16:    Goodbye Stranger - Supertramp\n15:    Let's Go - The Cars\n14:    Sail On - The Commodores\n13:    Suspicions - Eddie Rabbitt\nARCHIVES: Loving You - Minnie Riperton\n12:    Lonesome Loser - The Little River Band\n11:    Bad Girls - Donna Summer\n10:    I'll Never Love This Way Again - Dionne Warwick\n9:    Mama Can't Buy You Love - Elton John\n8:    Sad Eyes - Robert John\n7:    Lead Me On - Maxine Nightingale\n6:    The Devil Went Down To Georgia - The Charlie Daniels Band\n5:    Don't Bring Me Down - The Electric Light Orchestra\n4:    After The Love Has Gone - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n3:    The Main Event/Fight - Barbra Streisand\nARCHIVES: Lady Marmalade - Labelle\n2:    Good Times - Chic\n1:    My Sharona - The Knack\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92fa56a8b783cd6091e37971215bd67428eb6391","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1979_September_1st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92fa56a8b783cd6091e37971215bd67428eb6391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,250,86,168,183,131,205,96,145,227,121,113,33,91,214,116,40,235,99,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
