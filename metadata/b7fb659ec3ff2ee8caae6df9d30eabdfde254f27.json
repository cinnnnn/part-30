From Danish director Lone Scherfig (ON OUR OWN), ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS uses natural lighting, muted cinematography, and a partially improvised script--falling into the Dogme 95 genre. The film is not about learning Italian, though the film\\&amp;#039;s six thirtysomething characters all meet each other through an Italian class at the community center in their quiet, rainy town. The film is about real life and hardship and hope. A nurturing hair stylist, a clumsy bakery clerk, a committed pastor, a foulmouthed waiter, a friendly hotel manager, and a lonely waitress all struggle with the banality of daily life, while dealing with their own unique challenges. But as they begin to reveal themselves and their problems to each other, they form a bond and a network that is both a safety net and a new reason to live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7fb659ec3ff2ee8caae6df9d30eabdfde254f27","amp;dn":"Italian+for+Beginners.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7fb659ec3ff2ee8caae6df9d30eabdfde254f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,251,101,158,195,255,46,232,202,174,109,249,211,14,171,223,222,37,79,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
