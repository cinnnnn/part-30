The Scarlet is good, the transition jam is funky and interesting, but it's the FIRE \nthat really grabs you. Brent is just all over the first third, rippling and punching and filling with \nall kinds of calypso-themed riffs, just infusing this version with island rhythms....then Jerry breaks \ninto the fore after the 2nd verse and rages this sucker right into a picture-perfect return coda. It's \ngold, and falls into my top 3 FIREs of all time.\n\nOverall, this show has a very groovy feel...it's less speeded-out than a lot of its early-80's bretheren \n(e.g. check out the behind-the-backbeat groove on &quot;Women R Smarter&quot;)...Brent and Bobby goof around with \nthe cadence and tempo and it's clear they're having a blast.\n\nAlso, Garcia's vocals in this show, while '84 raw to be sure, actually hold together, and the effect is \nmore Tom Waits-ish than the sad frog-in-a-blender pinchiness that accompanies most every post-'83 \nperformance. he shines especially on the aforementioned FIRE and ALABAMA and again on an inspired HE'S GONE.\n\nThe SPACE is &quot;Allah&quot;-tinged which makes it more interesting than most and they finish up w/a fine \nT-STONES/NFA combo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ebd17443ba0dd579451d8cde736d5262df28a2a","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1984-03-31+-+Marin+County+Veterans+Aud+in+San+Ra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ebd17443ba0dd579451d8cde736d5262df28a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,189,23,68,59,160,221,87,148,81,216,205,231,54,213,38,45,242,138,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
