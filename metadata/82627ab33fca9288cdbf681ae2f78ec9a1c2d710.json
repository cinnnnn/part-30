The World Service series Ã¢â‚¬Å“WitnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ found an old recording Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the date was not given Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of an eye witness account from a New Zealand officer of the Gallipoli campaign, in which he lost a leg.\n\nFor me, the interest came not from an account of the campaign itself, with its Ã¢â‚¬Å“jam tin bombsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reflecting a lack of ammunition on both sides. Instead, it was the attitudes of the time which this old soldier reflects, such as the order not to bring the wounded back from the front, and a transfer system that allowed wounded men to drown when being lifted onto the hospital ships.\n\nFor me though most memorable are the statement Ã¢â‚¬Å“luckily for me, I got my leg blown orfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“they said on board the hospital ship Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyou can have any drink you likeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, so I said Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a bottle of champagneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nA tiny snapshot of an amazing man from a now lost world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82627ab33fca9288cdbf681ae2f78ec9a1c2d710","amp;dn":"Gallipoli+-+An+Eyewitness+Account+-+BBC+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82627ab33fca9288cdbf681ae2f78ec9a1c2d710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,98,122,179,63,202,146,136,205,191,104,26,226,247,142,201,161,194,215,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
