Spend 15 seconds with the introductory tutorial and you'll be able to start typing with MinuumÃ¢â‚¬â€instantly. The more you type, the better Minuum gets. Try it now.\n\nSIMPLIFIED TYPING\nMost virtual keyboards take an approach similar to cramming a full typewriter into a touchscreen device. Resulting keyboard apps cover up half the usable touchscreen space (or more), obstructing your content. Minuum gives you back your screen space by minimizing the keyboard.\n\nNEW EMOJI PANEL\nMinuum provides exciting new ways to enjoy your screen space through the Ã¢â‚¬Å“always-openÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ emoji panel option. This lets you effortlessly add fun and playful emoticons to all your messages--including Snapchat. \n\nMULTI-LANGUAGE CAPABILITY\nDownload different language modules and switch between them. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to hear your feedback on the quality of our dictionaries as we beta test new languages. We currently support:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ English\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Spanish (beta)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ French (beta)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ German (beta)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Italian (beta)\n\nHOW MINUUM WORKS\nMinuum re-imagines the keyboard by reducing a standard layout to a single line Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a continuum of letters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ letting you type quickly and accurately without needing large keys. We enable this by auto-correction algorithms that allow highly imprecise typing, knowing what you mean even if you miss every single letter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009cd020af180737c40a654c545b8e2a00a194fd","amp;dn":"Minuum+Keyboard+v1.2.5.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009cd020af180737c40a654c545b8e2a00a194fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,156,208,32,175,24,7,55,196,10,101,76,84,91,142,42,0,161,148,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
