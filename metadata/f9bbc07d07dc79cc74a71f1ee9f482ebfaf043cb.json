George Washington was more than just an inspiring battlefield commander; he was critical to the founding and success of the United States ofAmerica. His leadership, his vision, and his courage united a war-torncountry and set the United States on the path to greatness. Washington's historic contribution to this nation--his leadership and his character--are as relevant and valuable today as they have ever been.\n\nThis book reveals Washington's character, his leadership, his vision, and most surprising of all, his business skills and acumen. Most people aren't awarethat Washington, while all of the above, was also a successful businessman and visionary entrepreneur.\n\nExhibiting qualities sorely lacking in so many of our political and business leaders today, Washington remained steadfastly honest and ethical,following guiding principles that would benefit leaders around the world. George Washington's Leadership Lessons reveals a man of true character,worthy of emulation not just in the realm of politics and war, but in allleadership positions. \n\n\nGeorge Washington has long been a role model for Americans. Legends of his honesty and virtue are part of America's cultural heritage. But Washington's legacy is much greater than the apocryphal story of the cherry tree. George Washington's Leadership Lessons offers a unique perspective on America's first presidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not as a caricature of model behavior, but as an effective, visionary, and inspiring leader of men. \n\nFar more than just an able military strategist, Washington was a charismatic leader who inspired confidence in others whether he was leading troops, leading the nation, or leading a business venture. Now, James Rees, Executive Director of Mount Vernon, plumbs the historical record to reveal how Washington developed his leadership skills and built a reputation as an honest, effective, and ethical leader. \n\nRees breaks down Washington's leadership skills into fifteen lessons that encapsulate great leadership and reveal why Washington was so effective. Using stories from Washington's life, as well as his own writings, Rees shows how these leadership skills aided him not only on the battlefield but also in business. In addition to the fifteen leadership lessons, Rees includes the Rules of Civility that helped Washington initially develop the qualities of a great leader and a comprehensive look at one of the lesser-known sides of George Washington: the entrepreneur. \n\nFew Americans realize that Washington's estate at Mount Vernon was far more than a beautiful plantationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it was also the site of the nation's largest whiskey distillery, a very sophisticated milling operation, and a remarkable fishery that netted 1.5 million herring in a seven-week season. And who would have imagined that the founder of our country introduced the hard-working mule to hundreds of American farmers? \n\nGeorge Washington's Leadership Lessons presents a compelling and complex vision of Washington as a modern role model for every American, especially those who lead others. Offering true insight into the unexamined leadership skills of a great American, this unique and insightful book reveals true qualities of leadership that every American should take to heart. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9bbc07d07dc79cc74a71f1ee9f482ebfaf043cb","amp;dn":"George+Washington%5C%27s+Leadership+Lessons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9bbc07d07dc79cc74a71f1ee9f482ebfaf043cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,187,192,125,7,220,121,204,116,167,31,30,233,244,130,235,250,240,67,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
