In the appetizer round, a freeze-dried surprise in the basket has the chefs scrambling to add much-needed flavor to their plates. A large loaf, getting a perfectly grilled chop and a tough candy make for a challenging second round. The last two military chefs go head-to-head in the dessert round, both badly wanting the win.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 28-May-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:714d1907b5bce39be7bff78b8b4d7beb7ffd428d","amp;dn":"Chopped.S15E08.Military.Salute.HDTV.XviD-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"714d1907b5bce39be7bff78b8b4d7beb7ffd428d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,77,25,7,181,188,227,155,231,191,247,139,139,77,123,235,127,253,66,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
