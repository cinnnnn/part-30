That it is part of the revived Blue Series is ironic. What we are doing is rounding up a vast array ot jazz, soul and latin grooves from EMI's vaults. \nWe have monstrously rare sitar-funk on Anandar Shankar, the obscure Tina Britt's take of Don Covoy's &quot;Sookie, Sookie&quot; and the latin jazz extravaganza of Norman Connor's &quot;Samba For Maria&quot; featuring Blue Note mainstay Freddie Hubbard on trumpet. \nFor those amused by the quirky, the presence of Cliff Richard is around with Shadow's drummer Brian Bennett, whose &quot;Soul Mission&quot; is lifted from his incredibly rare &quot;Greater London Noise&quot; LP. At the other end of the scale we have a million seller albeit as a ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ side - in Bobby Gentry's Memphis soaked &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot;\nBlue Juice - ready to pour!
