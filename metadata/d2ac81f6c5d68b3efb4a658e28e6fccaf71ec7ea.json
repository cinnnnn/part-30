By 1970 the band now known as Supertramp had released their first eponymous album in the UK (it was released in 1975 in the US).\n\nAfter a change of line-up, the new band recorded Indelibly Stamped in 1971. Though it achieved cult popularity, commercial success evaded them. Their millionaire sponsor Stanley August Miesegaes withdrew his support and everybody left the band except Davies and Roger Hodgson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ac81f6c5d68b3efb4a658e28e6fccaf71ec7ea","amp;dn":"Supertramp+-+Supertramp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ac81f6c5d68b3efb4a658e28e6fccaf71ec7ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,172,129,246,197,214,139,62,251,74,101,142,40,230,252,202,247,30,199,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
