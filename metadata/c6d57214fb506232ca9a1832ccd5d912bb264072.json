This is a genuine copy of the film, all other 'Death Race 1973' torrents I have found to date have turned out to be Death Race 2000 or 2008!\n\nIn the North African desert in World War II, a damaged American fighter plane that is unable to take off tries to evade and destroy a pursuing Nazi tank.\n\nDirector: David Lowell Rich\nWriter: Charles Kuenstle\nStars: Lloyd Bridges, Roy Thinnes and Eric Braeden\n\nOwned VHS copy converted to m4v video file - plays well on VLC player. It's watchable but not outstanding in recording quality.\n\nVideo: 7/10\nAudio (English): 8/10\n\n\nNot sure if this TV film will ever make it to DVD, so please take this very rare opportunity to download this short film! I will be seeding for only the next 60 days or so.\n\nSo please seed this as much as possible!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d57214fb506232ca9a1832ccd5d912bb264072","amp;dn":"Death+Race+1973+%28State+of+Division%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d57214fb506232ca9a1832ccd5d912bb264072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,213,114,20,251,80,98,50,202,154,24,50,204,213,217,18,187,38,64,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
