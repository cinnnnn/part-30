It answers questions that many IT professionals and newcomers ask about the tools and skills needed to survive one of the most complex career fields in the world. Most computer books deal with configuring software and do little to help you learn what you need to know to work in a network office environment. Most people are rarely prepared for the social, political, or psychological aptitude needed to survive the office workplace. Most computer books are software proprietary and never tell you what types of programs you will really need to know.\n\nMany of the topics in this book are situations based on my experience and the experiences of other computer professionals that you would not typically have access to without actually having a job in an IT department.It also contains notes sent to me from well-established IT professionals about their experiences. This book is a mix of fact and story, humor and frustration. So, if you are new to the field of computers, Hacking the IT Cube is going to give you a unique insight that only experience can teach. On the other hand, if you are a seasoned veteran, you will laugh and cry at familiar situations that have sent you to a place of liquid intoxication. \n\nDetails\n\n    * Paperback: 300 pages\n    * Publisher: TheNetworkAdministrator.com; 1 edition (January 1, 2006)\n\nFile Format:\n\n    * PDF\n\n\nUploaded by: Aerocaria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f787ba931d2112db6aa64695074b839219fb16c","amp;dn":"Hacking+the+IT+Cube%3A+The+Information+Technology+Department+Survi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f787ba931d2112db6aa64695074b839219fb16c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,120,123,169,49,210,17,45,182,170,100,105,80,116,184,57,33,159,177,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
