Ogni emozione ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ stata bandita perchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© considerata la vera radice del male e origine di ogni guerra. Per sedare le emozioni lo stato fornisce una droga obbligatoria, il Prozium, che dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  a tutti lo stesso fittizio equilibrio. Squadre speciali di poliziotti addestrati hanno il compito di scovare i ribelli. John Preston, alto funzionario governativo, ha sempre creduto fermamente nel sistema fino a quando per caso salta una dose di Prozium e scopre un nuovo mondo di sensazioni che gli danno il coraggio di lottare per la libertÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â . \nfonte:  Visit this link: http://www.ibs.it/dvd/8007038052584/librium/equilibrium.html\n\nBiography\nKlaus Badelt, born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1968 is a composer, best known for composing film scores. Badelt started his musical career composing for many successful movies and commercials in his homeland. In 1998, Oscar-winning film composer Hans Zimmer invited Badelt to work at Media Ventures in Santa Monica, his studio co-owned by Jay Rifkin. Since then, Badelt has been working on a number of his own film and television projects such as The Time Machine and K-19: The Widowmaker. He has also collaborated with other Media Ventures composers, such as Harry Gregson-Williams, John Powell, and Zimmer.\nWhile collaborating with Zimmer, Badelt has contributed to the Oscar-nominated scores for The Thin Red Line and The Prince of Egypt, as well as writing music for many well known directors including Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Terrence Mallick, John Woo, Kathryn Bigelow, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, Gore Verbinski, and Steven Spielberg.\nBadelt co-produced the score to Hollywood box office hit Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, as well as writing portions of the score with singer/composer Lisa Gerrard. Having contributed music to Gladiator, Mission: Impossible 2 and Michael Kamen's score for X-Men, Badelt was involved in the three most successful movies in 2000. Badelt also collaborated with Zimmer on other successful films, such as The Pledge, and 2001 blockbusters Hannibal and Pearl Harbor. He also made a score for Pirates of The Caribbean.\nKlaus Badelt's score for Dreamworks' remake of The Time Machine earned him the Discovery of the Year Award at the World Soundtrack Awards 2003. He has composed for many other movies as detailed below.\nfonte:  Visit this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Badelt\n\nFormat\nMP3 - 256 Kbps - 44 kHz\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d826d2c7e984ba4e47d3a659b15823e714dced2e","amp;dn":"Equilibrium+-+Original+Soundtrack+%282002%29%2C+%5BLOSSY+MP3+256kbps%5D+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d826d2c7e984ba4e47d3a659b15823e714dced2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,38,210,199,233,132,186,78,71,211,166,89,177,88,35,231,20,220,237,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
