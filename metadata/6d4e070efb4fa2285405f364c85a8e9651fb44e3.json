The studio has since upgraded, and many artists in Colorado for a concert tour or promotion tour stop by to play live on the radio. The station releases a CD every year in late November or early December with the best or most memorable Studio C performances. The CDs, titled KBCO Studio C followed by the volume number, sell out in a matter of hours and all proceeds from the album are donated to charity. Two retrospective CDs have been released combining the best of the previous CDs and a couple of unreleased songs.\n\n\nVolume 20 (2008)\nDisc 1:\n1.
