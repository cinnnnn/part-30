Lex has been at the top for years, and there's almost nothing she wouldn't do for the gang...and for its leader. Lie, steal, kill--but she bows to no one, not even Dallas O'Kane.\n\nHe'll settle for nothing less.\n\nDallas fought long and hard to carve a slice of order out of the chaos of the sectors. Dangers both large and small threaten his people, but it's nothing he can't handle. His liquor business is flourishing, and new opportunities fuel his ambition. Lex could help him expand his empire, something he wants almost as much as he wants her. And no one says no to the king of Sector Four.\n\nFalling into bed is easy, but their sexual games are anything but casual. Attraction quickly turns to obsession, and their careful dance of heady dominance and sweet submission uncovers a need so deep, so strong, it could crush them both.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5ad0faae9cbd2460d8a65a5a30cd8fa3f00dd4","amp;dn":"Beyond+Pain+%26ndash%3B+Kit+Rocha%7B2013%7D%5BEPUB%2BMOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5ad0faae9cbd2460d8a65a5a30cd8fa3f00dd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,90,208,250,174,156,189,36,96,216,166,90,90,48,205,143,163,240,13,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
