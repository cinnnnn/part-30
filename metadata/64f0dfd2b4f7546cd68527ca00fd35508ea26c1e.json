The hooks, the lyrics, and the beat make for some of the most awesome loud stereo playin' to bring the house down (any house)...These guys have that special something that deserves and commands notice. EVERYTHING on this disc is so damn catchy and highly enjoyable.A mix of alternative with some undertones of hard rockin' country and you can even hear undertones of blues ( listen carefully and you'll know what I mean). The first track kicks things off with a dose of tongue and cheek play with words (and due to censorship,the actual title is not Bum For Egypt---but something a little more catchy) !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f0dfd2b4f7546cd68527ca00fd35508ea26c1e","amp;dn":"Dash+Rip+Rock+-+Not+Of+This+World+%5B1990%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f0dfd2b4f7546cd68527ca00fd35508ea26c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,240,223,210,180,247,84,108,214,133,39,202,0,253,53,80,142,162,108,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
