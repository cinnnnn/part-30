But\nwhile both live in the same decrepit, battered home on opposing ends of\ndifferent floors, there lies space in between the floorboards for a genetic\ncousin in The Gay Blades. With their dirty boots planted in the ground and their\nguitar-laden brains in the clouds, the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sophomore album Savages represents\nan unseen musical concept in the dark, heavy jungle of modern blues-rock: bona\nfide pop music.\n\nThat pop music feel is best exemplified in a kind of naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve abandonment as\nopposed to the more sullen disgrace or out and out fury of some of their\ncontemporaries. The height of that abandonment is hit early in the album with\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTry To UnderstandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a sax-heavy track that burns with the rock and roll energy\nof some revival in a backwoods town or an Anywhere, USA senior prom, with all\nthe intensity and heartache and confusion and utter thrill that goes along with\nthe panicked, sweat-soaked epiphanies. But that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t develop\nbeyond the initial flash-in-the-pan appeal. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWasted on the YouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a bit of\nthe afterglow of that youthful energy; it wallows in an acoustic glory, drenched\nin vocals of pure defeat, creating a balance between some of the down-home\nelements and the pomp and circumstance of Top 40. But in terms of a balance\nbetween the two, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurns and ShakesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ should draw a lot of attention. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a slow\nstart, but by the ending barrage of jamming guitars and distorted wailing,\ntheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve given you a roundhouse kick to remind you theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not just about gooey\nemotions; these boys can rock.\n\nOf course, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good thing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurns and ShakesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ comes so close to the end of the\nalbum, as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d forget about their rockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ skills in a lot of the rest of the\nLPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s offerings. The problem with too much pop is that it can water down that\ndestructive tinge that makes blues-rock so thrilling in the first place.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Like A GhostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo Cool To QuitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are equally as guilty of overt\nand borderline-offensive rock gone soft. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo Cool To QuitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and its title arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\neven the worst part of this manic dive toward the bad-hair metal end of the rock\npool. The formerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blown-out piano line and cries to Heaven above go beyond any\nsort of coyness and breakdown into sheer hymn-like hell. But while those tracks\nare annoying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvery Night Is Like A RevivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is truly the most disappointing of\nthem all. In hitting a lot of the same notes and concepts as some of its\naforementioned musically-pleasing brethren, it falls short in the most basic\npitfall of pop music: inconsistency. The songs that worked did so because they\nhad a great message that sparkled with despair and yet were wrapped in the\nwarmth of a pop hook. Now theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve resorted to tossing aside the depth for the\nrush of a mediocre chorus.\n\nMaybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unfair to put this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtrash popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ duo from Brooklyn in the same league\nas The Dead WeatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and The Black KeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s of the world. Sure, they come close to\nfinding their own little niche in between the nooks and crannies of the othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nbombastic creations, but some of those little rock-pop hybrids just arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that\ninteresting. In the end, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to you to put them where you want, genre-wise.\nOtherwise, they might just get lost in the shuffle.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f259858ffd06d919be9ad82186cbc16f432fc46","amp;dn":"The+Gay+Blades-Savages-2010-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f259858ffd06d919be9ad82186cbc16f432fc46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,37,152,88,255,208,109,145,155,233,173,130,24,108,188,22,244,50,252,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
