Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favor by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realizes that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109813/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109813/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77367d3290af9a427f867fee2c2fe6bfe7273bab","amp;dn":"Flintstones+The+Movie+%281994%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77367d3290af9a427f867fee2c2fe6bfe7273bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,54,125,50,144,175,154,66,127,134,127,238,44,47,230,191,231,39,59,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
