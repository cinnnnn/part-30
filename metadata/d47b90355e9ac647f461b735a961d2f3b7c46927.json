When space is at a premium, growing decent food to eat might seem an impossible task. Patio Produce is about just that; growing delicious, wholesome fruit and vegetables in the smallest spaces. It shows you how to make the most of pots and planters; how to create decorative but edible displays; how to plan for a reasonable yield; and how never to run out of at least something special to eat. If you have a balcony on a high rise, a roof garden or a patio, you can immeasurably enhance your quality of life, maintain your health and enjoy some amazing meals from the freshest and richest ingredients. Patio Produce goes from plant pot to plate. Think quality, freshness, flavour and put these thoughts into your ever greening fingers. Inside there are detailed step-by-step instructions how to grow on the patio - not just for novelty's sake, but for flavour and an enhanced eating experience.
