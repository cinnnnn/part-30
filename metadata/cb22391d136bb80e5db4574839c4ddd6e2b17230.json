Cheese. But Anne Dudley gave up on skittering electronic pop long ago (though not before doing some damage in collaboration with Frankie Goes to Hollywood). She conjured an offbeat vibe for The Crying Game, then earned an Oscar in 1997 for the score to The Full Monty. With American History X, Dudley takes her most serious turn, composing a suite of songs that reflect the foreboding, tragic plot of Tony Kaye's startling film. Using Tchaikovsky-like orchestration and a pristine boys' choir, she covers a range of emotions. A string section's squalls evoke high-pitched tension; a brass-led movement reflects sorrow and frustration; the soaring voices suggest redemption. It's a moving score, at once troubling and hopeful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb22391d136bb80e5db4574839c4ddd6e2b17230","amp;dn":"American+History+X%3A+SOUNDTRACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb22391d136bb80e5db4574839c4ddd6e2b17230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,34,57,29,19,107,184,14,93,180,87,72,57,196,221,214,226,177,114,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
