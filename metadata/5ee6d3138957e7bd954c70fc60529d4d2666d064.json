Universal Music has revealed the complete details for the November 21 reissue of the Rolling StonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 1978 Some Girls across multiple formats.  Following in the footsteps of last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Exile on Main Street set, Some Girls will offer a number of previously-unreleased songs, recently completed by the Stones, as Jagger told German network ZDF last month: that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve just been in the studio finishing some outtakes from 1978 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to be released [on] a rerelease of Some Girls.  So these are going to be some 10 extra tracks from that time [that] were never released.\nNo doubt collectors and casual fans alike will be anxious to revisit Some Girls.  The chart-topping album remains the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest-selling album in the United States, and was the Rolling StonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first to feature Ronnie Wood as a full member of the band line-up.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a more accessible album than Exile, and includes the classics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeast of BurdenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMiss YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as well as fan favorite ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShatteredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and even a raw, greasy Motown cover of The TemptationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust My Imagination (Running Away with Me).ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nNovember 21 is the date to mark for Some Girls in all its various incarnations. \nThe Rolling Stones, Some Girls (Rolling Stones Records COC 39108 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ reissued Universal Music, 2011 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deluxe/Super Deluxe/Vinyl)\n \n \n\nThe Rolling Stones\nMick Jagger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead and backing vocals, electric guitar, piano on &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot;\nKeith Richards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals, lead vocals on &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, bass guitar on &quot;Some Girls&quot; and &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;, piano on &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot;\nRonnie Wood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric, acoustic, pedal steel, and slide guitar, backing vocals, bass guitar on &quot;Shattered&quot;, bass drum on &quot;Shattered&quot;\nCharlie Watts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nBill Wyman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, synthesiser on &quot;Some Girls&quot;\nAdditional personnel\nSugar Blue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica on &quot;Miss You&quot; and &quot;Some Girls&quot;\nMel Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone on &quot;Miss You&quot;\nSimon Kirke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ congas on &quot;Miss You&quot;\nIan McLagan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric piano on &quot;Miss You&quot;, organ on &quot;Imagination&quot;\n\nGenre: Rock\nCountry: UK\nTracklist\nCD 1\n01.
