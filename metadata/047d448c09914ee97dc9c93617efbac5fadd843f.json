The pilot is based on the Mexican TV series Ellas son la AlegrÃƒÂ­a del Hogar, which translates to English as Ã¢â‚¬Å“They Are a HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and was heavily influenced by Desperate Housewives. The Mexican series is based on an original concept by Gloria Calzada, Juan Meyer and Salvador Rizo. The American adaption was to follow four maids with ambition and dreams of their own while they work for the rich and famous in Beverly Hills, California.
