It then proceeds in a methodical manner to cover the equipment for research scale fermentation labs, the different types of fermenters available, their uses and modes of operation. Once the lab is equipped, the issues of fermentation media, preservation strains and strain improvement strategies are documented, along with the use of mathematical modelling as a method for prediction and control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f31674a891b898083bafe82984b3ee2b1b99ad1","amp;dn":"Practical+Fermentation+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f31674a891b898083bafe82984b3ee2b1b99ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,49,103,74,137,27,137,128,131,186,254,130,152,75,62,226,177,185,154,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
