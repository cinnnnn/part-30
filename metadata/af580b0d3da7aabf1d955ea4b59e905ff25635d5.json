Twelve Classic One-Hour Episodes From The Acclaimed TV Series Devoted To Vietnam's Key Battles. Judgement of the Vietnam war has been clouded by issues which occurred away from Vietnam: the campus protests, the controversial presidencies of Johnson and Nixon, the agonised arguments over MIAs and POWs and the tormented veterans of that war. For so many people, the Vietnam War brings to mind events in America, not in Vietnam. When thoughts turn to Vietnam, attention focuses on a young girl burned by the napalm, piles of bodies at My Lai and the summary execution of a Viet Cong insurgent on the streets of Saigon. Those events are important, but they do not shed a great deal of light on the military realities of the conflict. Battlefield Series Three: Vietnam was the first definitive documentary of the Vietnam War as a war. It will intentionally avoid the subsidiary issues which cloud judgement of the war, so that a clearer picture of what actually happened on the ground and in the air will emerge.\n\n\nSpecs\n-----\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: ~1500 KB/s\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\nAudio Codec: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio BitRate: 192 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 01:00\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 700 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af580b0d3da7aabf1d955ea4b59e905ff25635d5","amp;dn":"Battlefield.Vietnam.07of12.War.On.The.DMZ.XviD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af580b0d3da7aabf1d955ea4b59e905ff25635d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,88,11,13,61,167,170,191,29,149,94,164,181,158,144,95,242,86,53,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
