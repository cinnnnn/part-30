Baker is teamed with tenor-saxophonist Bobby Jaspar and pianist Rene Urtreger for four selections, interacts with the tenor of Jean-Louis Chautemps and pianist Francy Boland on the next four songs and is finally heard with a fine French octet. Throughout this entire series, the trumpeter is in fine form. The third volume of the Barclay/Emarcy recordings is probably the least essential, and illustrates the degree to which Chet benefited from a guiding hand in the studio. It comprises three separate recording sessions. The first is excellent, and features Bobby Jaspar on tenor and RenÃƒÂ© Urtreger on piano. Sadly the band only recorded four tunes; this may be down to time pressure, since Chet had just returned from Iceland. The second session was recorded in February with ChetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working band, which included Jean-Louis Chautemps on tenor. Again, only four tracks were recorded, and the existence of multiple takes suggests some frustration with the heavy-handed drumming of Saudrais. The final session features three songs composed for Chet by Pierre Michelot and Christian Chevalier, and later re-recorded for the Big Band LP.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Chekeetah\n2 How About You\n3 Exitus\n4 Dear Old Stockholm\n5 Speak Low\n6 Anticipated Blues\n7 Cheryl\n8 Tasty Pudding\n9 Mythe\n10 Not Too Slow\n11 Vline S\n12 In a Little Provincial Town\n\n\nPersonnel: Chet Baker (tr), RenÃƒÂ© Urtreger (p), Francy Boland (p), Benoit Quersin (b), Eddie de Haas (b), Bobby Jaspar (ts), Jean-Louis Chautemps (ts), Armand Migiani (ts), Teddy Ameline (as), William Boucaya (bs), Benny Vasseur (trb), Jean-Louis Viale (dr), Charles Saudrais (dr), Pierre Lemarchand (dr)r ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71d05683a35a8c8e75c8c4f1a2fc4168a31a9d8","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Chet+in+Paris+vol.+3+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71d05683a35a8c8e75c8c4f1a2fc4168a31a9d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,29,5,104,58,53,168,200,231,92,140,79,26,47,196,22,138,49,169,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
