They were formed in 1976 by Tom Petty (guitar and vocals), Mike Campbell (lead guitar), Benmont Tench (piano, organ, harmonium and vocals), (the three of them had been members of Mudcrutch), Ron Blair (bass and vocals) and Stan Lynch (drums and vocals). Petty and the Heartbreakers are known for hit singles such as &quot;American Girl&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;The Waiting&quot;, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, &quot;Refugee&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance&quot;. The Heartbreakers still tour regularly and continue to record albums.\n\nPetty has fought against his record company on more than one occasion, first in 1979 over transference to another label and then again in 1981 over the price of his record, which was (at that time) considered expensive. He is also outspoken on the current state of the music industry and modern radio stations. On his 2002 album, The Last DJ, Petty sang about that and other issues and talked about them on the bonus DVD that came with the limited edition album.\n\nAlthough most of their material is produced and performed under the name &quot;The Heartbreakers&quot;, they have also participated in outside projects, with Petty himself releasing solo albums, the most successful being 1989's Full Moon Fever.\n\nPetty, Campbell and Tench, along with Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, recorded an album by Mudcrutch. This was the band's first album, made more significant by the fact that they had not recorded together since 1974. In June 2010 through early September, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers embarked on a tour following the release of their new studio album titled Mojo on June 15, 2010. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLong After Dark is the fifth album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in November 1982 on Backstreet Records. Notable for the major MTV hit &quot;You Got Lucky&quot;, the album was also the first to feature the late Howie Epstein on bass and harmony vocals. Epstein's vocals are evident throughout the album, most notably on &quot;Change of Heart&quot;. From this point on Epstein's vocals became an integral part of the Heartbreakers' sound. In addition, it was the first Heartbreakers album to feature a real synthesizer on record. There was a song recorded for this album called &quot;Keeping Me Alive&quot;, which Petty himself is very fond of but the producer, Jimmy Iovine, disliked. Petty has expressed that he feels the album would have turned out better if the song had been included on the album.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members.\n\n\nTom Petty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, 6 and 12 string acoustic and electric guitars, lead guitar on &quot;We Stand a Chance&quot;, Prophet 5 synthesizer\n\nMike Campbell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, 12-string guitar, organ on &quot;We Stand a Chance&quot;\n\nBenmont Tench Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic and electric pianos, Hammond and Vox organs, synthesizer, backing vocals\n\nStan Lynch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, backing vocals\n\nHowie Epstein Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nPhil Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ percussion\n\nRon Blair Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar on &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4a1002c67cdb8efae1ebae46624d38822a944e","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty...+-+Long+After+Dark+%5B1982%5D%5B2001%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4a1002c67cdb8efae1ebae46624d38822a944e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,74,16,2,198,124,219,142,250,225,235,174,70,98,77,56,130,42,148,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
