These songs do not unlock the secrets of Delta blues or Malian spirit music. But there is a kinship between these musicians, and their art reveals that fact in loud, living, present-tense terms, even as it invites us to contemplate the unsolvable riddles of the past. \nMali is an enormous, landlocked country that fills the interior of West Africa. It stretches from the Sahara desert in the north, to the edge of the coastal rain forests in the south. The country&amp;#039;s biggest waterway, the Niger River, winds its way northward from Guinea, through the Malian capital, Bamako. It continues up to Segu, center of the old Bambara Empire and ancestral home to many artists on this compilation, and then on to Timbuktu at the edge of the Sahara. \n\nTracklist:\nAmadou/Mariam - Mon Amour, Ma Cherie \nJohn Lee Hooker - I&amp;#039;m In The Mood \nHabib Koite - Sirata \nRokia Traore - Sabali \nGuy Davis - You Don&amp;#039;t Know My Mind \nBoubacar Traore - Kar Kar Madison \nEric Bibb - Don&amp;#039;t Ever Let Nobody Drag Your Spirit Down \nLobi Traore - Dounouya \nMuddy Waters - My Home Is In The Delta \nJessie Mae Hemphill - Standing in My Doorway Crying \nBaba Djan - Sabari \nTaj Mahal - Queen Bee \n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62fae1d9220814611396779b514da845cd6ce5fb","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Mali+To+Memphis+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62fae1d9220814611396779b514da845cd6ce5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,250,225,217,34,8,20,97,19,150,119,155,81,77,168,69,205,108,229,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
