As a man of science, our hero will quickly come to question logical thought and reason in favor of the horrors heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seeing before his eyes. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an evil lurking at the core of Hell Lock, and it will be up to you to make your way to an epic confrontation at the end.\nVampire Saga: Break Out is set to contain nine different hidden object scenes and 36 different eye, or item scanning scenes. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to click on useful items in hotspots that will be placed in your inventory, or can drag missing items onto their pictures to recreate scenes along the way. There are 18 mini-games to solve as you progress, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also come across 20 animated story scenes that are set to add to the scare-factor in huge ways.\n\n\n\nextract and play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e75b96290edeed593639c35568c626df16600c","amp;dn":"Vampire+Saga+Break+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e75b96290edeed593639c35568c626df16600c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,231,91,150,41,14,222,237,89,54,57,195,85,104,198,38,223,22,96,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
