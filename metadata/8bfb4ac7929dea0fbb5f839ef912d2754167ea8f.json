However, the seal has\nweakened and more humans are able to wander into Gensokyo from the outside.\n\nEven if the original setting is from a series of games the stories can be\nenjoyed also by people who never played them.\n\n\n\nIt is some time that gensokyo dot org does not update its torrent and I\nwas amazed there are still seeders for the original torrents of the 2009.\nSo here is an update. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bfb4ac7929dea0fbb5f839ef912d2754167ea8f","amp;dn":"gensokyo+dot+org+archive+at+2012+03+14+%28touhou+comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bfb4ac7929dea0fbb5f839ef912d2754167ea8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,251,74,199,146,157,234,15,187,95,131,158,249,18,210,117,65,103,234,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
