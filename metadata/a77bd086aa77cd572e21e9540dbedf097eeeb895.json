The textbook explores three important issues: how languages and language change are systematic; how the inner history of a language is profoundly affected by its outer history of political and culural events; and how the English of the past has everywhere left its traces on present-day English. By uncovering the language's past, one can better use it to communicate as well as speculate about its future use in ever-changing globalized media.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 478 pages\n# Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 3 edition (January 1, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495906417\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495906414","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a77bd086aa77cd572e21e9540dbedf097eeeb895","amp;dn":"A+Biography+of+the+English+Language+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a77bd086aa77cd572e21e9540dbedf097eeeb895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,123,208,134,170,119,205,87,46,33,233,84,13,190,223,9,126,238,184,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
