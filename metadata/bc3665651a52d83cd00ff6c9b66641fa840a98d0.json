Anthea \n&gt; Matt Zeremes ...  Michael \n&gt; Ryan Johnson ...  Tyson \n&gt; Cindy Nelson ...  Kath \n&gt; Gyton Grantley ...  Jake \n&gt; \n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anthea is undergoing a crisis of confidence:\n&gt; overworked, no boyfriend, struggling to find\n&gt; goals - and all her friends are leaving Brisbane.\n&gt; She is tempted to leave herself, but is opposed by \n&gt; her long time best platonic male friend Michael.\n&gt; Michael thinks people who leave Brisbane are copycats\n&gt; who follow the crowd; he is quite happy to stay in\n&gt; Brisbane, he is in a stable job and a stable very \n&gt; low-maintenance sex-with-the-ex relationship with\n&gt; his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie. He is in a rut. Anthea&amp;#039;s \n&gt; temptation to leave Brisbane increases with the impending\n&gt; departure of her flatmate Kath. However she then hears \n&gt; that an ex-boyfriend of hers Jake is coming back to Brisbane\n&gt; to live. To Michael&amp;#039;s annoyance, she dreams of a great future \n&gt; with him. Michael is thrown out of his comfort zone by starting\n&gt; a new relationship with a girl he meets at work, Simone. Slightly\n&gt; alternate&quot; and good natured, Simone is totally different from \n&gt; the sorts of girls he normally deals with, and he finds himself \n&gt; in a relationship over which he does not have total control. \n&gt; On her last day in Australia, Anthea and Michael finally resolve \n&gt; their feelings for each other.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3665651a52d83cd00ff6c9b66641fa840a98d0","amp;dn":"All+My+Friends+Are+Leaving+Brisbane+%5B2007%5DDVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3665651a52d83cd00ff6c9b66641fa840a98d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,54,101,101,26,82,216,60,208,15,246,201,182,102,65,250,132,10,152,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
