Offering a superb blend of lightning-fast superbike racing and hairpin curve-infested motocross events, it became an instant classic. It's got a bunch of nifty features, like two driving models (arcade and simulation), vivid graphics that look pretty nice even today and a broad selection of motorcycles to choose from. But all these look pale when compared to this game's sheer fun factor, which will make you want to keep on playing and will burn itself into your memories forever.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\nPolice Quest 1-2-3-4\nPrince of Persia 2008\nLionheart: Legacy of the Crusade\nBeyond Divinity\nStonekeep\nDeus Ex 2: Invisible War\nDriftmoon\nSilver\nRunaway series\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\nEdna &amp; Harvey: TB + HE\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f0cd77ae1f3c0a35754df2cb503303e8ed8919","amp;dn":"Moto+Racer+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f0cd77ae1f3c0a35754df2cb503303e8ed8919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,240,205,119,174,31,60,10,53,117,77,242,203,80,51,3,232,237,137,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
