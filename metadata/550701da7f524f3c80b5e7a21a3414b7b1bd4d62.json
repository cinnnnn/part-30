It is the long-awaited follow-up to Derek Parfit's 1984 book Reasons and Persons, one of the landmarks of twentieth-century philosophy. Parfit now presents a powerful new treatment of reasons, rationality, and normativity, and a critical examination of three systematic moral theories - Kant's ethics, contractualism, and consequentialism - leading to his own ground-breaking synthetic conclusion. Along the way he discusses a wide range of moral issues, such as the significance of consent, treating people as a means rather than an end, and free will and responsibility. On What Matters is already the most-discussed work in moral philosophy: its publication is likely to establish it as a modern classic which everyone working on moral philosophy will have to read, and which many others will turn to for stimulation and illumination. \n\nvol.1\nHardcover: 592 pages \nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA (June 20, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n\nvol.2\n848 pages \nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA (June 20, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550701da7f524f3c80b5e7a21a3414b7b1bd4d62","amp;dn":"On+What+Matters+vols.+1+and+2+Parfit+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550701da7f524f3c80b5e7a21a3414b7b1bd4d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,7,1,218,127,82,79,60,128,181,231,162,26,52,20,183,177,189,77,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
