Simulation helps you understand hardware configurations and avoids time wasted on setup problems. Additionally, with simulation, you can write and test applications before target hardware is available.\nWhen you are ready to begin testing your software application with target hardware, use the MON51, MON390, MONADI, or FlashMON51 Target Monitors, the ISD51 In-System Debugger, or the ULINK USB-JTAG Adapter to download and test program code on your target system.\n\n\nThe new Keil Ã‚ÂµVision4 IDE has been designed to enhance developer's productivity, enabling faster, more efficient program development.\nÃ‚ÂµVision4 introduces a flexible window management system, enabling you to drag and drop individual windows anywhere on the visual surface including support for Multiple Monitors.\n\nÃ‚ÂµVision4 builds on the popular Ã‚ÂµVision3 IDE with the addition of:\n\nTop New Features\nMultiple Monitor and flexible window management system\nSystem Viewer windows display device peripheral register information\nDebug Restore Views create and save multiple debug window layouts\nMulti-Project Workspace simplify working with numerous projects\n\n\n\nApp Name:  Keil C51 \nFile Size: 30.3 MB\nVersion:   4\n\nEnjoy !! :)\n\nUploaded by digdino on demand by EEYY WAKEYY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8674830af3cb72d617ec3c15c64d2178e836d2e5","amp;dn":"Keil+C51+%3A%3A+uVision+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8674830af3cb72d617ec3c15c64d2178e836d2e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,116,131,10,243,203,114,214,23,236,60,21,198,77,33,120,232,54,210,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
