By the time this music was recorded to four-track in 1982, the immensely popular band had been playing nightly for years at a Dakar club called Baobab. But legendary status in Senegal didn't help the musicians get wider attention--the album wasn't released in Europe until 1987, and it only now comes to the U.S. for the first time. Latin music was popular in Dakar, a port city, and the band mixed various strains of Latin music with different African music styles to create uniformly stunning results not all that different from Afro-Cuban music. The French vocals are lovely, and the powerful mix of African and Latin percussion is undeniable--but keep a particular ear out for guitarist Barthelemy Attisso, whose tasteful leads float over the top. The original six-track album is hard to pass up, but this reissue contains a second disk with six unreleased songs from the same session, making this a must-have. --Tad Hendrickson &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Pirates-Choice-Orchestra-Baobab/dp/B00005UPF7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Pirates-Choice-Orchestra-Baobab/dp/B00005UPF7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBBC World Music Awards &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/world/awardsbaobab.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/world/awardsbaobab.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\nCD 1\n1- Utru Horas\n2- Coumba\n3- Ledi Ndieme M'Bodj\n4- Werente Serigne\n5- Ray M'Bele\n6- Soldadi\n\nCD 2\n1- Ngalam\n2- Toumaranke\n3- Foire Internationale\n4- La Rebellion\n5- Ndiaga Niaw\n6- Balla Daffe\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ad14698951dccbe34f7cb339f54be92495ac00","amp;dn":"Orchestra+Baobab+-+Pirates+Choice+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ad14698951dccbe34f7cb339f54be92495ac00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,173,20,105,137,81,220,203,227,79,124,179,57,245,75,233,36,149,172,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
