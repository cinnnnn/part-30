Initially called Holiday, the band released its first EP, To Whomever May Still Be Concerned, in fall 2003. Changing its name to Evaline the next year, the quintet was comprised of Richard-Jonathan Perry, Christian Lewis, Steven Forrest, Dominic DiCiano, and Steven Pederson. Their music soon fell on the ears of the Useds Quinn Allman; the band would later trek up to Salt Lake City to record its next effort with him in the production seat. The resulting EP, Postpartum Modesty, A Portrait of Skin, was a lush display of rock dramatics and issued in July 2006 on Maverick. Their first full-length, Woven Material, wouldn't surface until 2011.\n\n\nReleased: 2006, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nQuality: Variable Bit Rate\nCodec: MP3\n\nWoven Material - 2011\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
