He's a real wuss. However, as fate would have it, responsibility for the tribe's survival falls on Ronal's scrawny shoulders, when the evil Lord Volcazar raids the village and abducts every living barbarian. With the exception of Ronal, who is forced to go on a perilous quest to save his enslaved clan and thwart Volcazar's plot to rule the world. Along the way, our unlikely hero is joined by Alibert the buttery bard, Zandra the gorgeous shield-maiden and Elric the metrosexual elfin guide. To ultimately vanquish the enemy, the band must overcome awesome challenges.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629374/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629374/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVIDEO:\nFormat........: MKV\nFile Size.....: 2.57 GB\nLength........: 1:29:18\nResolution....: 1280 x 536\nBit rate......: 2125 kbps\nFrame rate....: 23.98 fps\nAspect Ratio..: 2.39:1\n\nSubtitles.....: English, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish\n\nAUDIO:\nAudio#1.......: AC3 5.1\nLanguage......: Danish\nBit rate......: 625 kbps\nSample Rate...: 48000 kbps\n\nAudio#2.......: DTS 5.1\nLanguage......: Danish\nBit rate......: 1500 kbps\nSample Rate...: 48000 kbps\n\nSource........: Ronal.Barbaren.2011.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-WiKi\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf55bffaaf58d8240678b616bc31e571df65ed06","amp;dn":"Ronal.the.Barbarian.2011.BluRay.720p.x264.DTS%2BAC3.%5BNordic+Subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf55bffaaf58d8240678b616bc31e571df65ed06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,85,191,250,175,88,216,36,6,120,182,22,188,49,229,113,223,101,237,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
