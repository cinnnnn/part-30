W. Griffith, in Good Morning, Babylon. Vincent Spano and Joaquim de Almeida star as Nicola and Andrea Bonnano, the latest in a long line of Tuscany-born cathedral builders. Emigrating to America, the brothers settle in Los Angeles in 1915, even as director Griffith (Charles Dance) is preparing his epic production Intolerance. The boys are hired to help construct the massive sets for the film's Babylonian sequence (hence the title), for no other reason than the fact that Griffith is impressed by Italian craftsmanship. As the film progresses, Nicola and Andrea assimilate to their new surroundings, even launching a romance with a pair of pretty movie extras. On the verge of continuing the family tradition, the boys' ambitions are cut short by events well beyond their control. Still, their past artistic accomplishments, like those of their forebears, survive the ages -- but only on the ethereal silver screen.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Paolo &amp; Vittorio Taviani - Good Morning Babilonia.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1726 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.9 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1647 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.267\n      StreamSize : 1.30 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 70 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 56.8 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : VBR (mtrh)\n\nIMDB: tt0093104\n\nEnglish (with some Italian) audio, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by pas6sur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15f863c273350e85bfbedac83e7cc6396088bad0","amp;dn":"Paolo+%26+Vittorio+Taviani+-+Good+Morning+Babylon+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15f863c273350e85bfbedac83e7cc6396088bad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,248,99,194,115,53,14,133,191,190,218,200,62,124,198,57,96,136,186,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
