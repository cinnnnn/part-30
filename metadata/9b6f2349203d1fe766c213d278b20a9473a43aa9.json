Born in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal, on 2 March, 1948, he grew up in the city of Cork. Based in London during most of his 30-year career, he toured extensively, sold 30 million records, and had a worldwide following of loyal fans. He died in London at the early age of 47, on 14 June 1995, from complications following a liver transplant. Although he had suffered health problems for some time, he toured until falling seriously ill late in 1994. Gallagher was a master of the guitar and he was influenced heavily not only by rock and roll, but by blues and jazz also. \n\n____________\n\nReposted after re-creating the ISO.

Thanks to original poster, and please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6f2349203d1fe766c213d278b20a9473a43aa9","amp;dn":"Rory+Gallagher+%26ndash%3B+Irish+Tour+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6f2349203d1fe766c213d278b20a9473a43aa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,111,35,73,32,61,31,231,102,194,19,210,120,178,10,148,115,164,58,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
