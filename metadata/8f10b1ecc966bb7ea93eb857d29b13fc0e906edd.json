November 1, 1938). A somewhat forgotten figure until recently, Pucho never achieved the wide recognition of some other Latin jazz performers exploring similar territory, such as Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, and Cal Tjader. The timbales player and bandleader also may have been too eclectic, and too open to outside influences, to achieve much recognition within the jazz community.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s a weakness in one circle&amp;#039;s view, however, is a strength for other listeners. As a result, Pucho has a wider appeal than many straight jazz performers. Fans of R&amp;B, rock, and Latin music can immediately connect with him, especially as he&amp;#039;s always made sure to play music that&amp;#039;s hot and danceable. His accessibility, however, has by no means compromised the quality of his material or his Latin Soul Brothers bands, which have featured fine and versatile playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.
