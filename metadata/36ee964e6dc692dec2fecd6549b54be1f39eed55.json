There's no way around it.  'The Strings\nThat Bind Us' has such a strong,  eerie ambience,  that its 9 minutes of\npure  delusion will  send you off to an  outside world where nothing but\nthe  music matters.  Not that Arnej's trying to delude anyone,  creating\nnew sounds and worlds within them, is part of his nature. Thousands - if\nnot  millions  -  of  souls  have  gone  lost  in  the world of  Arnej's \nproductions, with 'They Always Come Back', 'Dust In The Wind', 'Tomorrow\nNever Comes'  and 'Beginning of the End' taking soul by soul.  After the \nmore uplifting, anti-Arnej track 'They Need Us', the Canadian mastermind\nreturns to his deep and dark prog-trance with 'The Strings That Bind Us'.\n\nIntense,  deep-rooted synths swirl  inside a maze of strings,  intricate\nvocals effects and the surroundings of melodrama. With 'The Strings That\nBind Us', Arnej's back doing the thing he's best in: creating new worlds\nwith unforgettable, timeless productions.\n\nYou'll  find  'The Strings That Bind Us'  not only on your  mp3  player,\nrocking your stereo or down the clubs,  but  also on  Armin van Buuren's\n'A State of Trance 2010'.\n\n\n************************************************************************\n\nTracklist\n\n************************************************************************\n\n\n01.
