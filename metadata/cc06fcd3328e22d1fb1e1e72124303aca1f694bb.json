All prints of Patriotism (Yukoku), which depicts the seppuku of an army officer, were destroyed after Mishima's death in 1970, though the negative was saved, and the film resurfaced thirty-five years later. New viewers will be stunned at the depth and clarity of Mishima's vision, as well as at his graphic depictions of sex and death.\n\n***\nName.........: Patriotism JPN.avi\nFilesize.....: 379 MB (or 388,876 KB or 398,209,024 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:27:38 (39,750 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1822 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 91 kb/s (45/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 720x544 (1.32:1) [~37:28]\nTexted intertitles are in Japanese, with hardsubbed English subtitles.\n(Criterion DVD rip; ggoes)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=2796&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=2796&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
