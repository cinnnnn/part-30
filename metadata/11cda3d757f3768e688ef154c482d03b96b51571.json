Of course, none of this can last. At a publicity party, the director succumbs to abdominal cramps severe enough to hospitalize him. Enter Alexandru Radulescu, an avant-garde director who says Shakespeare &quot;writes only about sex.&quot; As the provocative, spectacle-loving Radulescu slices and dices the comedy to shreds, Charles, who clings to a traditional interpretation, becomes increasingly resented by his colleagues, all of whom appear to be turning into Radulescu groupies. When, following a group dinner, another member of the company falls sufficiently ill to leave the show, Charles suspects foul play...\n\nFor followers of this series, this is classic Charles Paris, with the interminably struggling actor again giving us Brett&amp;#039;s wry and entertaining view of the theater.\n\nWith:\n-----\nCharles Paris....Bill Nighy\nFrances....Suzanne Burden\nMaurice....Jon Glover\nKen Carter....Peter Wight\nAlex Radelescu....Julian Rhind-Tutt\nVivienne Marlin....Elizabeth Bell\nGavin Scholes....Thomas Wheatley\nJack Bradley....John Cummins\nSally Luther....Tracy Wiles\nBen Ritson....Tom Lawrence\nVasile Bogdan....Ryan McCluskey\nDirector Sally Avens \n\n-----------------------\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.95\n-----------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cda3d757f3768e688ef154c482d03b96b51571","amp;dn":"A+Charles+Paris+Mystery+-+Sicken+and+So+Die+-+BBC+Radio+2006+-+c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cda3d757f3768e688ef154c482d03b96b51571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,205,163,215,87,243,118,142,104,142,241,84,196,130,208,59,150,181,21,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
