I ripped it to FLAC using the current updated version of XLD for Mac, running 10.6.5, using XLD's CD Paranoia Mode. Drive offset corrected, drive doesn't cache audio data. No errors on the rip. I included cover art as well as FLAC fingerprints and an MD5 file, the latter 2 generated with xACT.\n\nOver the last couple of years I've I managed to find torrents of the other 5 albums in the American series (Vols. 2-6) in FLAC format (EAC-FLAC in most cases), but all lossless torrents for this first volume are currently dead (I've been using an MP3 source in iTunes). So I bought this like new CD via Amazon for CHEAP and ripped it losslessly myself. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have !!!\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Delia's Gone&quot; (Karl Silbersdorf, Dick Toops)  2:18 Originally recorded by Cash for The Sound of Johnny Cash (1962)\n2. &quot;Let the Train Blow the Whistle&quot; (Cash)  2:15\n3. &quot;The Beast in Me&quot; (Nick Lowe)  2:45 Originally recorded by Lowe for The Impossible Bird (1994)\n4. &quot;Drive On&quot; (Cash)  2:23\n5. &quot;Why Me Lord&quot; (Kris Kristofferson)  2:20 Originally recorded by Kristofferson for Jesus Was a Capricorn (1972)\n6. &quot;Thirteen&quot; (Glenn Danzig)  2:29 Written by Glenn Danzig for Cash.
