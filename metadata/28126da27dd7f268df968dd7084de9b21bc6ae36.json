In this world he is pursued by a government agent who has a history with Matheson -- a history both men have long forgotten. \n\nMatheson has also forgotten that he has an incredible power: the ability to move through space and time with just a thought. As he learns more about his power, he uncovers a conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of government, with his very life at risk as he tries to come to grips with a power that can change the very fabric of space itself.\n\nGenre: Fiction | Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28126da27dd7f268df968dd7084de9b21bc6ae36","amp;dn":"Awake+by+Scott+C.+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28126da27dd7f268df968dd7084de9b21bc6ae36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,18,109,162,125,215,242,104,223,150,141,215,8,77,233,178,27,198,174,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
