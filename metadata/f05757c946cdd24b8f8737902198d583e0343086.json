Focuses are placed on materials (nanoparticles, dendrimer, CNT), fabrication (LB film, SAM, alternative adsorption, microcontact printing, photofabrication) and characterization (scanning probe microscopy and electron microscopy) on the nanoscale. Emerging applications to nanophotonics and nanobionics are discussed as well.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings have been selected for coverage in:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Materials Science Citation IndexÂ®\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Index to Scientific &amp; Technical Proceedings (ISTP CDROM version / ISI Proceedings)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05757c946cdd24b8f8737902198d583e0343086","amp;dn":"AsiaNANO+2002+-+Masatsugu+Shimomura%2C+Teruya+Ishihara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05757c946cdd24b8f8737902198d583e0343086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,87,87,201,70,205,210,75,143,135,55,144,33,152,213,131,224,52,48,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
