Cosmic evolution includes physical, biological, and cultural evolution, and of these the latter is by far the most rapid.\n\nIn this volume, authors with diverse backgrounds in science, history, anthropology, and more, consider culture in the context of the cosmos. How does our knowledge of cosmic evolution affect terrestrial culture? Conversely, how does our knowledge of cultural evolution affect our thinking about possible cultures in the cosmos? Are life, mind, and culture of fundamental significance to the grand story of the cosmos that has generated its own self-understanding through science, rational reasoning, and mathematics? Might this lead to cultural evolution on a large enough scale to allow the universe to both create and steer itself toward its own destiny?\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8475fce5c7750c00f57c4ec96eaa5b840226a30","amp;dn":"Cosmos+and+Culture-Cultural+Evolution+in+a+Cosmic+Context%5BTeam+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8475fce5c7750c00f57c4ec96eaa5b840226a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,71,95,206,92,119,80,192,15,87,196,236,150,234,165,184,64,34,106,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
