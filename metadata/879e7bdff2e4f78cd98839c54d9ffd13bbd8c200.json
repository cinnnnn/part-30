This music though, is truly original in concept and in sound, and yet strangely enough, no school of playing seems to have come from it. It stands alone. I highly reccommend the recording for all thoughtful listeners who desire music played with a sense of mystery, an unidentifiable unity of message and superb musicianship. It is truly a work of art in jazz and improvised music.
