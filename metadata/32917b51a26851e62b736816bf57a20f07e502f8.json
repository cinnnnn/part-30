Over the course of the past 15 years John B has\n  become one of the most eclectic, unique and respected artists in electronic\n  music. His ability to stretch the elastic of drum &amp; bass over the past decade\n  has brought him together with an array of figureheads from all corners of the\n  scene from Metalheadz boss Goldie, to legendary global DJ Paul Oakenfold.\n  Defying categorisation, Johns catalogue straddles electro, punk rock, trance,\n  latin and drum &amp; bass. Now as we enter 2012 hes ready to drop his brand new\n  album Light Speed, a full-force electro/trance D&amp;B hybrid of truly epic\n  proportions. Featuring collaborations with an array of superb vocalists Light\n  Speed is a prime example of an artist not afraid to wear his heart on his\n  sleeve and follow his musical ideals, and with one of the busiest DJ schedules\n  in the business it seems the rest of the world would agree. Long live the John\n  B, original to the end! Truly international, John has brought dance music to\n  some of the farthest flung places on the globe, including Siberia and the sub\n  continent. And he has the air miles to prove it. He plays regular dates in\n  Russia, Miami, LA, and the Czech Republic, and has South American and Indian\n  tours coming up later this year. John's been a pioneer of sub genres through\n  his production and DJing as well as via the diverse releases from talent on\n  his own labels, Beta and Nu Electro. All of the artists nurtured within these\n  stables have gone on to achieve success in their own right. Nu:tone, Logistics\n  and Commix all began their careers working with John and have gone on to make\n  massive waves in dance music. More recent Beta graduates to the big time have\n  been Camo &amp; Krooked; Gemini; drum step outfit, Terravita; Receptor; and\n  Xilent, whose Ayah Marar remix was recently put out by MOS.And further\n  galvanising Johns affinity with Eastern Europe, Toolroom new boys Indivision\n  from Estonia, will be releasing a house track on Beta. While Russian outfit,\n  Gmorozov get bedded in at Nu Electro. Johns last album, Electrostep, saw him\n  credited with single-handedly developing a new style in drum and bass.\n  Scything through that years releases, it was hailed as a tongue in cheek\n  electro overdose for models and porn stars and garnered him a diverse and\n  unrivalled global fan base.His referencing of colourful counter-cultures such\n  as fetish, euro pop, burlesque, street fashion and the avant garde, have\n  brought him into the orbits of electrohouse scene favourites such as Larry\n  Tee, Mark Moore and Tommie Sunshine, who were all champions of Johns\n  Electrostep album. And his electro friendships dont end there. Hes done\n  remixes for Heaven 17, Howard Jones, My Robot Friend, and S'Express.More\n  recently Johns tracks have been receiving the remix treatment by some of the\n  most exciting new artists. His track, Red Sky, featuring Shaz Sparks, was\n  sampled by Nicky Minaj in her song Here I Am, and has been remixed by\n  cutting-edge producers Rebel Sonix and Subsonik &amp; Smooth. Jack Beats have also\n  put their own stamp on Johns seminal Up All Night, out on Herves Cheap Thrills\n  imprint. And at the time of writing this, the remix for Johns tune Numbers has\n  860,000 combined views on Youtube and counting. But hes been putting his\n  skills to good use in return, with trance and bass remixes for Anjunabeats\n  track; as well as Michael Cassettes Through the Windows; and drum and bass\n  remixes for chart topping bands such as Pendulum and Bloc Party. In 2009, John\n  was voted best drum and bass DJ in DJ Magazines top 100 poll. Last year D&amp;B\n  titan Andy C just pipped him to the post. But despite having to settle for\n  runner up, John leaped an impressive 16 places to finish at number 76 overall.\n  One of the first electronic artists to fully exploit the power of the\n  internet, Johns website www.john-b.com includes everything from his very own\n  personal blog and style diary to exclusive audio, back stage videoblogs,\n  glamour tips and outrageous tour photos. And by creating exclusive free\n  content hes been able to amass a hugely loyal global following. His live sets\n  and studio mixes regularly exceed 100,000 downloads and, as his podcasts near\n  their 150th episode theyve hit the itunes top 10 too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32917b51a26851e62b736816bf57a20f07e502f8","amp;dn":"John+B+-+Light+Speed+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32917b51a26851e62b736816bf57a20f07e502f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,145,123,81,162,104,81,230,43,115,104,22,191,87,162,15,7,229,2,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
