What you may ask? Recording a podcast for this site. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been on the to do list for some time, and now, we finally have a show to share. And, we are giving torrents a try, as a way to distribute our shows. So we'll see how this works.\n\nThis episode is just so you folks can get to know us. We go around, and introduce ourselves and just have some fun with it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a while, and like a guy who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten any in year, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re kind of slow to start so we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to quick. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll talk about a few of the stories we have already posted on the site and dive in deeper on our take of those stories. So sit back, pop a cold Ã¢â‚¬Å“adult beverageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and listen in. And please comment and let us know what you liked, and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like.\n\n\n\n\nFile Info\n------------\nKind:        MPEG Audio File\nSize:        41.7MB\nBit Rate:    160 kbps\nSample Rate: 44.100kHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66db4b80a7b46292c0c20b79b2092eea4772423d","amp;dn":"The+X-Cast+Podcast+Episode+1%3A+The+Beginning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66db4b80a7b46292c0c20b79b2092eea4772423d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,219,75,128,167,180,98,146,192,194,11,121,178,9,46,234,71,114,66,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
