If you missed it during its 15 minutes of availability back in 1985, here's your chance to make amends. De Waart doesn't miss a trick, making sure that the vigorous rhythms in the first and third movements are cleanly articulated, and that balances between the orchestra, organ, piano, and wind section never get confused. The finale remains one of the most exciting both interpretively and sonically, with Jean Guillou a predictably excellent soloist and the new Davies Hall organ sounding absolutely splendid. The final measures, with trumpets and timpani cutting through the hugely sonorous organ presence, surely represent exactly how this piece ought to go.&quot; --David Hurwitz (from the review of Eloquence 476 7417)\r\n\r\nCAMILLE SAINT-SAÃ‹NS (1835-1921)\r\nSymphony No. 3 in C minor &quot;Organ Symphony&quot;, Op. 78\r\n1.
