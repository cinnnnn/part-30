Heres My Fourth Video Contribution.... Enjoy!!!\n\n\n\n1.01 \t&quot;A New Family&quot;                    December 3, 2009 (2009-12-03)\n\nSummer at the Jersey Shore kicks off when eight soon-to-be roommates move into their summer share. Romance heats up between Sammi and Mike, but all might be lost when the guys invite three random girls to join them in the hot tub. Meanwhile, Snooki comes on way too strong, and finds herself the outcast. She can only hope that first impressions won't be lasting impressions. \n\n\n\n1.02 \t&quot;The Tanned Triangle&quot;             December 3, 2009 (2009-12-03)\n\nStill feeling like the outcast, Snooki tells the others that she's leaving the Shore. And the roommates' first night out at the club gets flirty, proving that the boyfriends back home might, in fact, have something to worry about. And what started with Mike and Sammi turns into a love triangle that threatens to divide the house. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45d3e7515bbc1964cf09394bfeff615dade50206","amp;dn":"Jersey_Shore_S1E01-02_GPB2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45d3e7515bbc1964cf09394bfeff615dade50206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,211,231,81,91,188,25,100,207,9,57,75,254,255,97,93,173,229,2,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
