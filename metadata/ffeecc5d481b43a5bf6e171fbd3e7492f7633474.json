The original Cambridge Medieval History was published between 1911 and 1936. That famous series is now out of print and has been replaced by The New Cambridge Medieval History which presents a reliable, detailed history from late antiquity to c. 1500. Published in seven volumes, with Volume IV divided into two parts, it provides a unique, authoritative guide to medieval life and thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffeecc5d481b43a5bf6e171fbd3e7492f7633474","amp;dn":"The+New+Cambridge+Medieval+History+%287+Volume%2C+8+Hardback+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffeecc5d481b43a5bf6e171fbd3e7492f7633474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,238,204,93,72,27,67,165,191,110,23,31,189,62,116,146,247,99,52,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
