ENJoY! \n\nPygmees Aka - Chants de Chasse, d'Amour et de Moquerie \n\n\nPygmies (singular: Pygmy) refers to a member of any human group whose adult males grow to less than 150 cm (4 feet 11 inches) in average height[1] or less than 155 cm.[2] A member of a slightly taller group is termed pygmoid. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efe and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Brazil and Bolivia.[2] The Negritos were the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia.[3] The remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.[4] \n\nWikipedia\n\n\n\nQuality: 256Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3579bffe84cf8bf9efa22fba70f3c15427b36010","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Pygmees+Aka+-+Chants+de+Chasse%2C+d%5C%27Amour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3579bffe84cf8bf9efa22fba70f3c15427b36010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,121,191,254,132,207,139,249,239,162,47,186,112,243,193,84,39,179,96,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
