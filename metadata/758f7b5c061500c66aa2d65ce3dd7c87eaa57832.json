Her vocals are smooth as honey and hugely emotive and her voice still has that irresistible frail breathlessness. The songs are well written with meaningful lyrics and the music, as always, is beautiful and intuitive. It's hard to believe there are only 3 musicians, including Harris, making all the music. Long, weeping fiddle notes and chunky, contemplative piano chords are balanced only by the occasional tentative brightness of a banjo or mandolin. The percussion is distant, if there at all, but always clever. 'Darlin' Kate' is about her close friend Kate McGarrigle who died last year of cancer. 'The Road' looks back to her formative years spent with the late Gram Parsons at the start of her career. 'Big Black Dog' is inspired by her animal shelter philanthropy and is the only almost-happy song on the album. 'My name is Emmett Till' is the true story of a 14 year old black boy killed in Mississippi for talking to a white woman. Overall the strength and sincerity of Harris' songs make this just another reason to love and respect her.\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nEmmylou Harris - Hard Bargain 2011\n(Nonesuch)\n\n 1.
