It is the story of a violent, war-haunted, alcoholic father and a strong-willed, loving mother who struggled to protect her three sons from the effects of poverty and ignorance that had tainted her own life. It is the story of the life Bragg was able to carve out for himself on the strength of his mother's encouragement and belief.\n\nAmazon.com Review\nOne reason Rick Bragg won a Pulitzer Prize for his feature articles at the New York Times is that he never forgets his roots. When he writes about death and violence in urban slums, Bragg draws on firsthand knowledge of how poverty deforms lives and on his personal belief in the dignity of poor people. His memoir of a hardscrabble Southern youth pays moving tribute to his indomitable mother and struggles to forgive his drunken father. All Over but the Shoutin' is beautifully achieved on both these counts--and many more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876997f7d72d3870f787182ae98a2c5cdf0f38db","amp;dn":"ALL+OVER+BUT+THE+SHOUTIN+-+Rick+Bragg.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876997f7d72d3870f787182ae98a2c5cdf0f38db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,105,151,247,215,45,56,112,247,135,24,42,233,138,44,92,223,15,56,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
