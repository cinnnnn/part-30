Various information is then relayed back to them; information such as who is or is not using legitimate copies of Space Engineers, the IP of your machine and the guid of the user, amongst many other things. A simplistic batch file to fix this has been included. The 64bit version is also included. If you experience errors with it, leave a comment.\n\nSpace Engineers v01.011.008 [Portable Steam Rip]\n*32bit Version Enabled.\n*64bit Version Enabled.\n\nTwo step run process.\n1.
