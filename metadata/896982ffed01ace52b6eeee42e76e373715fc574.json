On the other, he's trapped in an icy hell with a dodgy internet connection and a dictaphone. Loneliness is something of a problem.\n\nHis fellow travelling scientist Graham should alleviate this, but the tragi-comic fact is, they are nerdy blokes, so they can only stumble through yet another awkward exchange.\n\nBen experiences all the highs and lows that this beautiful, but lonely place has to offer but fails miserably to communicate this to Graham. So, Ben shares his thoughts with us in the form of an audio 'log'.\n\nApart from his research studying the Albatross on the Island, Ben attempts to continue normal life with an earnestness and enthusiasm which is ultimately very endearing. We're with him as chats awkwardly with Graham, telephones his mother and as he tries to form a long distance relationship with a woman through Chemistry.com.\n\nIn fact, we follow Ben as everything occurs to him. We also hear the pings and whirrs of machinery, the Squawks and screeches of the birds and the vast expanse outside. Oh, and ice. Lots of ice.\n\n(from http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/bird_island/)\n\n## Technical\n\nThis was recorded from the BBC iPlayer using rtmpdump, and cut and encoded using avconv 0.8.10 and libvorbis 1.3.2, using the following commands:\n\navconv -ss 104 -i Bird_Island_Series_2_-_Episode_1_b042l2xt_default.flv -codec libvorbis -t 00:13:57.500 1.ogg\navconv -ss 60 -i Bird_Island_Series_2_-_Episode_2_b042z66l_default.flv -codec libvorbis -t 00:13:35.500 2.ogg\navconv -ss 78 -i Bird_Island_Series_2_-_Episode_4_b044ghpd_default.flv -codec libvorbis -t 00:14:02 4.ogg\navconv -ss 79 -i Bird_Island_Series_2_-_Episode_3_b043wk17_default.flv -codec libvorbis -t 00:14:01 3.ogg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:896982ffed01ace52b6eeee42e76e373715fc574","amp;dn":"Bird+Island+S02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"896982ffed01ace52b6eeee42e76e373715fc574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,105,130,255,237,1,172,229,43,110,238,228,46,118,227,115,113,95,197,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
