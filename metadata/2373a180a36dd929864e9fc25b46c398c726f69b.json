It was then collected into two trade paperback volumes from 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005 and then an Absolute Edition in 2006. The story was adapted as an animated movie titled Justice League: The New Frontier, and released on February 26, 2008.\n\nThe series was influenced by works such as Kingdom Come, The Golden Age, Watchmen, and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Much like The Golden Age, New Frontier takes place primarily in the 1950s, and depicts the Golden Age superheroes Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman meeting Silver Age characters the Flash, Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter. The story bridges the gap from the end of the Golden Age to the beginning of the Silver Age in the DC Universe.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC:_The_New_Frontier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC:_The_New_Frontier&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/dc-the-new-frontier/49-10939/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/dc-the-new-frontier/49-10939/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2373a180a36dd929864e9fc25b46c398c726f69b","amp;dn":"DC%3A+The+New+Frontier+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2373a180a36dd929864e9fc25b46c398c726f69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,115,161,128,163,109,217,41,134,78,159,194,91,70,195,152,199,38,246,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
