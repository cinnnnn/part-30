Part of these extant sources are the Pseudepigrapha. This collection of Jewish and Christian writings shed light on early Judaism and Christianity and their doctrines.\n\nThis landmark 2-volume set includes all 65 Pseudepigraphical documents from the inter-testamental period that reveal the ongoing development of Judaism and the roots from which the Christian religion took its beliefs. A scholarly authority on each text contributes a translation, introduction, and critical notes for each text. Volume 1 features apocalyptic literature and testaments. Volume 2 includes expansions of the &quot;Old Testament&quot;: legends, wisdom, and philosophical literature; prayers, psalms, and odes; and fragments of lost Judeo-Hellenistic Works.\n\nTogether, both volumes present literature that shows the ongoing development of Judaism and the roots from which the Christian religion took its beliefs. Using the very latest techniques in biblical scholarship, this international team of recognized scholars has put together a monumental work that will enhance the study of Western religious heritage for years to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d900558ab7441cee076e01589e53c2330058ad37","amp;dn":"J.H.+Charlesworth%2C+ed.+-+Old+Testament+Pseudepigrapha+%282+vols.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d900558ab7441cee076e01589e53c2330058ad37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,0,85,138,183,68,28,238,7,110,1,88,158,83,194,51,0,88,173,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
