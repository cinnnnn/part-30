Forget about the old muddy sounding older releases... Here you get the greatest Genesis records in the best sounding version. Normally I'm not a fan of new mixed classic's because mostly they're sounding heavily compressed and equalized. But these records sound like I wished to hear them all the time. It turn some of the greatest ProgRock records into a great experience!!!\n\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\nClickRepair 3.0.1 with extremly light settings (DeClick 10/DeCrackle 0) has been used to remove some clicks present due to static charge of the vinyl.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE FIRST, STAY TUNE FOR THE OTHER\n\nTrespass (1970) Info\n\n\nSide one\n1. &quot;Looking for Someone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:06\n2. &quot;White Mountain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:45\n3. &quot;Visions of Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:51\n\nSide two\n1. &quot;Stagnation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:50\n2. &quot;Dusk&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n3. &quot;The Knife&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:56\n\nPersonnel\n* Peter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, woodwind, percussion\n* Anthony Phillips ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, backing vocals\n* Mike Rutherford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, guitar, nylon, backing vocals\n* Tony Banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, guitar, backing vocals\n* John Mayhew ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n\n\nWhile burning you should add a gap of approx 3 seconds between each track! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2253eb3a538c09cb934d70f836d75cc8fa2508eb","amp;dn":"Genesis-Trespass%281970%29%282008+Vinyl+Box%29%5BVinyl+Rip-FLAC%5D%5BTWR106%5D%5BC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2253eb3a538c09cb934d70f836d75cc8fa2508eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,83,235,58,83,140,9,203,147,77,112,248,54,215,92,200,250,37,8,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
