The band only released a couple of albums, then it split... but its music still lives on, or rather has been revived with a BANG! release, and this is well-deserved. So even though Frankie Say... No More, Frankie still say a lot!\n\nThis compilation contains the best track of the outstanding concept album &amp;#039;Welcome To The Pleasuredome&amp;#039;, such as the debut hit single &amp;#039;Relax&amp;#039; (regarded controversial back then!), the absolutely great &amp;#039;Two Tribes&amp;#039;, the breathtakingly beautiful ballad &amp;#039;The Power Of Love&amp;#039;, and an interesting and varied version of &amp;#039;Ferry Cross The Mersey&amp;#039;. Plus stuff from the less impressive &amp;#039;Liverpool&amp;#039; album, like &amp;#039;Rage Hard&amp;#039;, but sadly not including the wonderful &amp;#039;Is Anybody Out There?&amp;#039;.\n\nThe listener also has to live with more mediocre songs like &amp;#039;Warriors Of The Wasteland&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;For Heaven&amp;#039;s Sake&amp;#039;; both unmistakably Frankie but not really top quality. Still, as a whole, this compilation album makes you rock and think about the rocking 1980s. It&amp;#039;s a great memory.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Relax\n2. Two Tribes\n3. War\n4.
