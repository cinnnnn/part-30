This authoritative resource offers a clear and complete explanation of this necessary electromagnetics knowledge, providing the analytical fundamentals needed to understand the most important methods in the field, including MoM (method of moments), FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) techniques, and Green's functions.The book presents all math necessary to master the material and provides number of solved problems to ensure the understanding the key concepts. It also includes multiple choice questions, appropriate for self study or courses, that help clarify concepts without any mathematical burden. Packed with over 1,300 time-saving equations, all the problems presented in the book can be solved using nothing more than calculator.
