It consists of 6 episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae08bd0bbcfa6ae51fe141e71fd343af31194836","amp;dn":"Bread+Series+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae08bd0bbcfa6ae51fe141e71fd343af31194836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,8,189,11,188,250,106,229,31,225,65,231,31,211,67,175,49,25,72,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
