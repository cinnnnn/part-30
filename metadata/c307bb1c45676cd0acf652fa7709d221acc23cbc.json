They played hard rock music that also included blues-rock, psychedelic rock, rock &amp; roll and garage rock. &quot;Crystallizing the counterculture movement at its most volatile and threatening,&quot; their far left political ties and anti-establishment lyrics and music would serve as a prototype for later punk rock musicians. The band consisted of Wayne Kramer and Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith (guitars) Michael Davis (bass), Rob Tyner (vocals), and Dennis Thompson (drums).\n\nMC5 had a promising beginning which earned them a cover appearance on Rolling Stone magazine in 1969 even before their debut album was recorded. They developed a reputation for energetic live performances, one of which was recorded as the critically acclaimed Kick Out The Jams. Their career was ultimately short-lived, though within just a few years of their dissolution, the MC5 were often cited as one of the most important American hard rock groups of their era: their three albums are regarded as classics. Their song &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; is widely covered.\nFrom: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC5&lt;/a&gt;\nMore about Beat-Club Shows here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tv.com/beat-club/show/8970/summary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tv.com/beat-club/show/8970/summary.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLineup On The Video:\nRob Tyner - Vocals\nWayne Kramer - Guitar\nFred Smith - Gutar/Vocal\nDennis Thompson - Drums\nSeev Moorhouse - Bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c307bb1c45676cd0acf652fa7709d221acc23cbc","amp;dn":"MC5+-+Kick+Out+The+Jams+%28Beat-Club+1972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c307bb1c45676cd0acf652fa7709d221acc23cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,7,187,28,69,103,108,208,172,246,82,250,119,9,210,33,172,194,60,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
