If you start WinRAR command from Explorer context menu in multiple\n      monitor configuration, the command dialog will be displayed\n      on the same monitor as context menu. In previous versions it was\n      always displayed on primary monitor.\n\n   2. WinRAR &quot;Compress and email...&quot; context menu command adds the archive\n      name to email subject. Previous versions left the subject blank.\n\n   3. In RAR 3.91 -x switch could also exclude folders from archiving\n      even if mask contained wilcard characters and did not contain a path.\n      For example, -x*. excluded all those folders, which do not have\n      the extension in the name. Now -x switch uses RAR 3.80 approach\n      for masks without path, excluding folders only if mask does not\n      contain wildcards and matches the folder name exactly.\n\n   4. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) WinRAR 3.91 reported the incorrect &quot;Unexpected end of archive&quot;\n         error, when opening an empty ZIP archive created with\n         &quot;New WinRAR ZIP archive&quot; context menu command;\n\n      b) if &quot;Delete archive&quot; option was enabled when unpacking several\n         ZIP archives and if one of archives was damaged, WinRAR did not\n         delete archives after the damaged one, even if they were unpacked\n         successfully;\n\n      c) if file matched two different masks in RarFiles.lst, WinRAR\n         could select the last match. Normally, if neither of masks\n         is a subset of another, the first match must be chosen.\n\n\n\n1. Install Winrar x86\n\n2. Copy the rarkey file two your winrar folder on program files\n\n3. He is fully activated Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b76e12656bf7275d42c7edd6d4368ab48720f7","amp;dn":"Winrar+3.92+ENG+x64+%282010%29+FINAL%2B+Activation+%28NLRZ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b76e12656bf7275d42c7edd6d4368ab48720f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,183,110,18,101,107,247,39,93,66,199,237,214,212,54,138,180,135,32,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
