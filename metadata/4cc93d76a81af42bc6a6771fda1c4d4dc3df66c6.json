These men have returned deeply disturbed by their battle experiences and we follow their progress as they are helped to come to terms with their distress and to rebuild their shattered psyche.\n\nHow tragic that such a well-made and important film should have been kept from us for so long. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cc93d76a81af42bc6a6771fda1c4d4dc3df66c6","amp;dn":"Let+There+be+Light+%281946%29+60+min.Walter+Huston%2CCensored%2CWWII+Doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cc93d76a81af42bc6a6771fda1c4d4dc3df66c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,201,61,118,168,26,244,43,198,166,119,31,218,28,77,77,195,223,102,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
