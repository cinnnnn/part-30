Place pieces on the board to deflect bullets of energy that fire to the beat. Guide the bullets to the exit through 51 challenging levels featuring a variety of distinctive soundscapes. Your solutions create the music.\n\nHow to Play:\n\nEach puzzle comes with a set of pieces you can place on the board to deflect the bullets. To place a piece on the board, first touch the square where you'd like to place the piece, and then touch the piece. That's it!\n\nAward Winning Design:\n\nMicron began as a game created for Kongregate's 'Project Eden: Experience the Music' game contest, in which it won 2nd place. The judges included Tetsuya Mizuguchi, creator of REZ and LUMINES, and representatives from Ubisoft, Gamespot, and Kongregate.\n\n&quot;Classic visual like the Famicon but experiencing the process of sound effects evolving into the music felt really good. The harder the game, the more exciting the music getsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶this was blended perfectly.&quot; ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ Tetsuya Mizuguchi\n\nWhat's New:\n\nv1.24\n- Fixed some of the bonus levels.\n\nMore info:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apparitiongames.micron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apparitiongames.micron&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f73ce69605e41c9953921322cdf4947e878882c5","amp;dn":"Micron+v1.24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f73ce69605e41c9953921322cdf4947e878882c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,60,230,150,5,228,28,153,83,146,19,34,205,244,148,126,135,136,130,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
