Helen Brody, an FBI agent in L.A., is tasked with finding the bombs while a CIA &quot;consultant,&quot; known as H, interrogates the suspect who has allowed himself to be caught. The suspect, whose wife and children have left him and disappeared, seems to know exactly what the interrogation will entail. Even as H ratchets up the pressure, using torture over Brody's objection, the suspect doesn't crack. Should H do the unthinkable, and will Brody acquiesce? Is any Constitutional principle worth possible loss of life? \n\n\n\nGeneral Informaion\n\nGenres: Drama | Thriller\nRelease Date: 8 July 2010(Netherlands)\nUser Rating: 7.1/10 7.1/10 ( votes)\nLanguage: English\nCountry: USA\nUnthinkable.2010.Dvdrip.Xvid.EMPIrE\nFormat : AVI at 1 053 Kbps\n\nLength : 701 MiB for 1h 33mn 9s 640ms\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 915 Kbps\nAspect : 640 x 336 (1.905) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914863/\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72e5416d426dacdac63b05809b855eab3d2c2d1b","amp;dn":"Unthinkable.2010.Dvdrip.Xvid-EMPIrE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72e5416d426dacdac63b05809b855eab3d2c2d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,229,65,109,66,109,172,218,198,59,5,128,155,133,94,171,61,44,45,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
