Lacan's work is challenging too, for the way in which it recentres psychoanalysis on one of the most controversial points of Freud's theory - the concept of a self-destructive drive or &quot;death instinct&quot;. &quot;Death and Desire&quot; presents, in Lacanian terms, a new integration of psychoanalytic theory in which the battery of key Freudian concepts - from the dynamics of the Oedipus complex to the topography of ego, id, and superego - are seen to intersect in Freud's most far-reaching and speculative formulation of a drive toward death. Boothby argues that Lacan repositioned the theme of death in psychoanalysis in relation to Freud's main concern - the nature of fate and desire. In doing so, Lacan rediscovered Freud's essential insights in a manner so subtle and penetrating that prevailing assessments of the death instinct may well have to be re-examined. This book should be of interest to professionals in training and practice, undergraduates and graduates in the fields of psychoanalysis, literary criticism, philosophy and feminist theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d20a3e7958593eb20e14e5d884b1c660f3fa07f","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1991%5D+Death+and+Desire+Psychoanalytic+Theory+in+Lacan%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d20a3e7958593eb20e14e5d884b1c660f3fa07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,32,163,231,149,133,147,235,32,225,78,93,136,75,28,102,15,63,160,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
