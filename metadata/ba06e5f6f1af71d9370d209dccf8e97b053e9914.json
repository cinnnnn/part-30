After many years of neglect by their drug-addicted mother, Kim and her three older sisters were abandoned to the uncharitable care of the Sisters of Charity. \n\nDetailing daily regimens of physical and mental abuse at the hands of the nuns, this chilling memoir explains how the Roman Catholic Church kept the orphanage hidden from prying eyes, miles from any main thoroughfare, allowing mistreatment to continue for decades. Describing her life through adulthood and the decision to finally expose the injustices after more than 30years, this courageous tale chronicles the lawsuit initiated by 45 survivors, the two years of litigation, and the first successful prosecution of a lawsuit against Roman Catholic nuns in the US for decades of abuse in an orphanage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba06e5f6f1af71d9370d209dccf8e97b053e9914","amp;dn":"The+Unbreakable+Child+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba06e5f6f1af71d9370d209dccf8e97b053e9914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,6,229,246,241,175,113,217,55,13,32,157,204,248,233,123,5,62,153,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
