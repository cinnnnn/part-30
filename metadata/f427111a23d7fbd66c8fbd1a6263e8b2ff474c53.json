The talkers in question are AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Gregory, a renowned experimental theater director, and playwright and actor Wallace Shawn, both of whom play themselves. The film is not a documentary, but a condensation of several real discussions fashioned into a dramatic exchange by Shawn and director Louis Malle. The subtle conflict stems from the differences in the men's characters: Gregory is an inquisitive, uninhibited wanderer, willing to travel to remote lands to take part in unusual foreign rituals, while Shawn is the cynical, realistic New Yorker, more concerned with the challenges and rewards of day-to-day city life. Malle approaches their philosophical yet playful back-and-forth with a straightforward, minimal style that only rarely wanders outside its restaurant setting. The focus therefore falls on Shawn's and Gregory's contrasting verbal styles and facial expressions, highlighting conversational nuances normally lost on film. While the idea of watching any conversation for over 90 minutes, no matter how fascinating, may turn off some viewers, enough audiences have supported the film to make it an art-house classic.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : My.Dinner.With.Andre.1981.avi (split into 2 CDs)\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1738 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.5 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 0/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1656 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.280\n      StreamSize : 1.29 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 74 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 59.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.95 \n      Encoding settings : VBR (mtrh)\n\nIMDB: tt0082783\n\nEnglish audio, English, Spanish, French and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCriterion Collection Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f427111a23d7fbd66c8fbd1a6263e8b2ff474c53","amp;dn":"Louis+Malle+%281981%29+My+Dinner+With+Andre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f427111a23d7fbd66c8fbd1a6263e8b2ff474c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,39,17,26,35,215,251,214,108,143,189,26,98,99,232,178,255,71,76,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
