Even rats caught diseases there.' Welcome to the world of Miss, a bold new journey into crime graphic novels from Humanoids Publishing. Set during the early 1900s in New York, Miss tells the tale of two unlikely partners in crime, Enola and Slim. Enola is a poor white girl who has learned to survive by hook or by crook since being expelled from the orphanage. Slim is a black pimp with an uncertain past, trying to keep one foot out of the grave. When their paths cross, and their options run out, Enola and Slim forge a partnership as murderers for hire. This is their story ... what it takes to survive when all you have is a gun.\n\n\nENJOY!\n\nand if anyone can seed First Comics - First Adventures it would be much appreciated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f0a9c931fd0c1f23a536210599749d9061b798","amp;dn":"Miss%3A+Better+Living+Through+Crime+%5BThirault%2FRiou%2FVigouroux%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f0a9c931fd0c1f23a536210599749d9061b798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,240,169,201,49,253,12,31,35,165,54,33,5,153,116,157,144,97,183,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
