It was \nreleased in February 1987, reached #22 on the UK Singles Chart, and \nbarely nudged into the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nThis &quot;Skin Trade&quot; video was the second filmed for the band by directors \nPeter Kagan and Paula Greif, after &quot;Notorious&quot;. Film of band members \nperforming was treated with a rotoscope-like effect, adding vivid colors \nto details like a person's eyes or jewelry. Like so many other Duran \nDuran videos, &quot;Skin Trade&quot; included a beautiful woman - in this case \nGerman supermodel Tatjana Patitz. Her image was rotoscoped for some \nscenes as well, and her dancing figure was superimposed on several \ndifferent vividly colored abstract backgrounds. \n\nSession guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, who would later become a full member \nof the band, appears in the video, although his face is not often seen. \nCuccurullo also contributed the power chords and harmony parts on the \nbridges of the album track, with Nile Rodgers playing the others.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_Trade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_Trade&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:23\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
