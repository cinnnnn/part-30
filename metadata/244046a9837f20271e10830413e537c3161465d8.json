Here is a sublime sax trio. Martin Speicher (sax and\nclarinet), Georg Wolf (bass) and Lou Grassi (drums), bring some top level free\nimprovization. I only knew Grassi from his great Avanti Galoppi album, and the\nother two musicians are unknown to me, and that's unfortunate, because what\nthey bring on this album is really very strong. The three musicians listen well\nand carefully to each other, they search for new expressive power, and they\nfind it, bringing lots of variation, even within the same piece, sometimes\nintense and forward moving, then slow, sensitive, melancholic. Speicher has a\nwarm tone, even in the most hard-blowing moments, Wolf offers nice telepathic\ninteraction, and Lou Grassi keeps propulsing the band forward with excellent\ndrum work. The album starts very promising with &quot;Please, Confirm&quot;, in a lightly\ndancing mode with loose tones, which evolves into a high and sustained\npowerplay, just to end with reference to the beginning. &quot;Le Star&quot; brings slow\nsearching sounds, with Speicher looking for the high notes of his sax, eery,\nsad and powerful. &quot;Claire's Net&quot; begins dissonant and abstract, with Speicher\non bass clarinet and Wolf on arco bass, and although it would be too much to\nsay that something like a melody is created, it is a wonderful experience to\nnotice how out of this loose cluster of notes a musical unity evolves which is\nhard to define, yet which is unmistakably there. And that just characterizes\nthe whole album. Strong discipline and self-control, together with a common\nfocus on exploration in the creation of their musical vision permeate all\ntracks, and the result is more than worth listening to. The title song brings\nan excellent close to the album, with Speicher again on bass clarinet, and it\nis without a doubt the highlight of the album, ending in sad howling tones, the\nlikes of which you will not have heard before. Don't expect fixed melodies or\nrhythms, but what you get is a creative, intense and impactful modern jazz.\n\n--\n\nby Marc Medwin &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28058&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=28058&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndi Vincenzo Roggero (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=2012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=2012&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lougrassi.com/ShapesandShadowsReviews.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lougrassi.com/ShapesandShadowsReviews.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244046a9837f20271e10830413e537c3161465d8","amp;dn":"Martin+Speicher%2C+Georg+Wolf%2C+Lou+Grassi+-+Shapes+and+Shadows+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244046a9837f20271e10830413e537c3161465d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,64,70,169,131,127,32,39,30,16,131,4,19,229,55,195,22,20,101,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
