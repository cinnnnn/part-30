His family moved to Florida in 1965. Inspired by his father (who played country music) he picked up a harmonica as a teenager. When he was 18, he learned about the Blues from records by Sonny Boy Williamson and Paul Butterfield and was hooked. Rock would describe his influences 'As far as riffs go, my base is pretty much Sonny Boy 2, both Walters, and Howlin' Wolf. As far as attitude goes, my influences are Eddie Kirkland, Muddy Waters and Tampa Red! I like to put the tone and riffs of Chicago Blues on top of the rhythms and beats of New Orleans!'. By 1970 he was known as Rock Bottom and had submerged himself in the Blues, playing small roadhouses and jook joints around the Sarasota/Bradenton area of Florida with his first Blues band, Sugar Daddy. Later he played with the New Highway Man and achieved a local following with Nick Danger &amp; the Heat. Since the early 80s, Rock divided his time between The Silver King Band, Rock Bottom &amp; the Cutaways, and various freelance projects. The Silver King Band gained some success with their mix of Blues, jive and comedy. After 1993, The Cutaways became Rock's primary band, and he toured extensively in Europe, especially to Norway.\nAfter some serious health problems in 1991 and 1992 caused by years of hard living, Rock reformed his life style but continued his great style of Blues. Unfortunately on September 28th, 2001, just after returning from a European tour and recording 'Going Nowhere Fast', that hard living finally caught up with him and he left us to go 'Snake Dancin' Through 'God's Barnyard'.\nIn 2002 Rock was posthumously awarded the Florida Folk Heritage Award by the State of Florida at a ceremony in Tallahassee.\nAs performer and songwriter, Rock served up a masterful main course of blues seasoned with R&amp;B and the flavors of New Orleans. No artificial ingredients were ever used in the making of Rock's very own and very special recipe. After many years and many more miles, Rock started his recording career in 1979. Early efforts produced several now extremely collectable vinyl 45's and an album in 1983 which, today, fetches a fancy price amongst collectors.\nThis album contains material recorded from 1988 to 1994. Recorded for Belgium label Double Trouble, this was released in Belgium on 1996 by Parsifal.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aaec6952f04031e8f31a841fd08adbc32756b6c","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Rock+Bottom+-+Too+Many+Bad+Habits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aaec6952f04031e8f31a841fd08adbc32756b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,174,198,149,47,4,3,30,143,49,168,65,253,8,173,188,50,117,107,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
