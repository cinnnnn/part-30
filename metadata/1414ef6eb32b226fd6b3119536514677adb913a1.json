The veteran alto saxophonist, who was only two weeks away from his 60th birthday when this post-bop/be bop CD was recorded, evidently wanted to try something a bit different -- and it was a move that paid off creatively. Whether he's forming an intimate duo with guitarist Kenny Burrell or forming a quartet with Burrell, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Grady Tate, Morgan fares quite well without a pianist. This isn't an album of fast tempos and high-speed aggression -- from Burrell offerings like &quot;Listen to the Dawn&quot; and &quot;Remembering&quot; to highly personal interpretations of Gordon Jenkins' &quot;Goodbye,&quot; Duke Ellington's &quot;I Didn't Know About You&quot; (which becomes a sexy bossa nova), and the standard &quot;It Might as Well Be Spring,&quot; Morgan is especially introspective and really takes time to reflect. This compelling CD should not be missed. (AllMusic)\nA highly enjoyable, relaxing album.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Listen to the Dawn\n02 - Grooveyard\n03 - Remembering\n04 - Little Waltz\n05 - It Might as well be Spring\n06 - When Joanna Loved Me\n07 - I Didn't Know About You\n08 - Goodbye\n\nPersonnel:\nFrank Morgan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ alto saxophone\nKenny Burrell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nRon Carter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nGrady Tate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
