The local ensemble was born to \nconstant transition, forever in search of a fleeting moment. From the \nsketched intimacy of its eponymous debut in 2007 and youthful splendor of \n2008's Rivers Arms, to the colonial expanse of 2009 breakthrough All Is Wild, \nAll Is Silent and the eerie, restrained tranquility of 2010's Constellations, \nBalmorhea moves and morphs like weather patterns. Balmorhea's fifth studio \nalbum marks a dramatic transformation in approach and temperament, \npacking a visceral immediacy only teased with last year's Live at Sint-\nElisabethkerk. The compositions here are more self-contained and \ncomplicated, with everything ÃƒÂ» swelling strings, wordless vocals, xylophone, \nand steel drums ÃƒÂ» in its rightful place without sounding overly composed. \n&quot;Pyrakantha,&quot; meanwhile, bridges the band's past and present. A soft trance \nof pensive guitars fades into a bed of static synthesizers, which then settles \ninto a guitar groove subtly propelled by the nuanced percussion of stellar \nnew addition Kendall Clark. Centerpiece &quot;Artifact&quot; uncovers an epic unto \nitself, a three-part suite venturing into prog rock. Layers of guitar arpeggios \nand rolling piano top circling guitar loops in a game of chutes and ladders \nbetween Muller and Lowe that climaxes akin to Explosions in the Sky by the \nway of Robert Fripp's The Repercussions of Angelic Behavior. With Stranger, \nBalmorhea finally comes into full bloom. (CD release: Mohawk, Friday, Sept. \n28.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929918e394ef9ded578c9d8e702c24cbd1f10f87","amp;dn":"Balmorhea+-+Stranger+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929918e394ef9ded578c9d8e702c24cbd1f10f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,153,24,227,148,239,157,237,87,140,157,142,112,44,36,203,209,241,15,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
