Now, with classic titles such as Economist on Wall Street, A Primer on Money, Banking, and Gold, and The Price of ProsperityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which have forewords by financial luminaries and new introductions by the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½you can enjoy some of the best of Bernstein in his earlier Wall Street days.\n\nWith the proliferation of financial instruments, new areas of instability, and innovative capital market strategies, many economists and investors have lost sight of the fundamentals of the financial systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½its strengths as well as its weaknesses. A Primer on Money, Banking, and Gold takes you back to the beginning and sorts out all the pieces.\n\nPeter Bernstein skillfully addresses how and why commercial banks lend and invest, where money comes from, how it moves from hand to hand, and the critical role of interest rates. He explores the Federal Reserve System and the consequences of the Fed's actions on the overall economy. But this book is not just about the past. Bernstein's novel perspective on gold and the dollar is critical for today's decision makers, as he provides extensive views on the future of money, banking, and gold in the world economy.\n\nThis illuminating story about the heart of our economic system is essential reading at a time when developments in finance are more important than ever.
