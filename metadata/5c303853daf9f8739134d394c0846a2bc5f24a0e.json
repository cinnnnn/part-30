Musically, it's a decent early 70's hard rock with organ &amp; fuzz guitar. All material was penned by the leder Carlo Mastrangelo (who also played with Dion and the Belmonts). It's probably one of the few hard rock albums which features a kazoo solo! \n\n01.Understanding\n02.Peace I\n03.I Want to Live\n04.I'LL Cry Tomorrow\n05.Why Can't She See Me\n06.Peace II\n07.She's Coming Home\n08.Break of day\n09.Long Ago\n10.Peace III ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c303853daf9f8739134d394c0846a2bc5f24a0e","amp;dn":"Pulse+-+Pulse+%281971%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c303853daf9f8739134d394c0846a2bc5f24a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,48,56,83,218,249,248,115,145,52,211,148,192,132,106,43,197,242,74,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
