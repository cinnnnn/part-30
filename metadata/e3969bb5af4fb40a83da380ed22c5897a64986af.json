Two of the numbers are\nsolos, seven are duets with drummer Tyshawn Sorey, and three are quintet\npieces. The music primarily sets brooding moods, sometimes with rhythms,\nsometimes not. Few of the pieces are long enough to overstay their welcome (most\nend abruptly), but the overall effect is still mostly disturbing and\nepisodic. Some listeners will find these explorations to be stimulants for\nthought, while others will consider them a bit of a bore since they do not\ninclude much development beyond the sounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3969bb5af4fb40a83da380ed22c5897a64986af","amp;dn":"Steve+Lehman+-+Demian+As+Posthuman+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3969bb5af4fb40a83da380ed22c5897a64986af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,150,155,181,175,79,180,10,131,218,56,14,210,44,88,151,166,73,134,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
