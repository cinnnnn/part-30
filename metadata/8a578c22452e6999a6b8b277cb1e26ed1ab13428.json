From here, he muses on what makes a convincing poster, by breaking down an idea and making it new.\n\nMilton Glaser's work is easy to spot in a lineup -- it's simple, direct and clear, while leaping over conceptual boundaries, so that his work connects directly to the viewer like a happy virus. His best-known work may be the I [heart] N Y logo -- an image so ubiquitous, it's hard to believe there was a time when it didn't exist.\n\nGlaser's other well-known work includes a cache of posters that defined the style of the '60s and early '70s, and numerous logos, including such instantly familiar identities as Barron's and the Brooklyn Brewery. He is a co-founder of New York magazine and helped set that magazine's honest and irreverent tone.\n\nRecently he's been exploring the space where paintings and graphic design meet. A show in 2007 celebrated his explorations of Piero della Francesca's work.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\n\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
