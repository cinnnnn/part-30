Fronted by lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi , Bon Jovi formed in 1983 with guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, bassist Alec John Such and drummer Tico Torres. Other than the departure of Alec John Such in 1994 and replaced by Hugh McDonald, the lineup has remained the same for the past 26 years. After two moderately successful albums in 1984 and 1985, the band scored big with Slippery When Wet (1986) and New Jersey (1988), which launched the band into global super stardom.\nAfter non-stop touring, the band went on hiatus after the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith and has since created successful albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Their latest album, The Circle, is set to be released on November 10, 2009.\nThroughout their career, the band has released ten studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album; and have sold over 120 million albums worldwide. They have performed more than 2,600 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. In 2006 Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and in 2004 they were ranked number 14 in Q magazine's 50 Greatest Bands of All Time. The band was also honored with the Award Of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004. As songwriters and collaborators, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\n\nThese Days\n\nThese Days is Bon Jovi's sixth studio album, and was released on June 27, 1995. This was the first album Bon Jovi released after the firing of bassist Alec John Such. Hugh McDonald unofficially replaced Such as bassist. At the time of release, the album was a huge commercial hit, particularly in Europe and Japan but failed to impress the audience in the United States. In the UK, the album was particularly notable for producing four Top 10 hit singles. The high sales of the album in Europe auspicied a re-issue of the album under the name of These Days Special Edition a year after its original release. The album was remastered and re-released in 1998, adding the music video for &quot;These Days&quot; as a bonus track.\nThese Days was the first album Bon Jovi released after the firing of bassist Alec John Such. Hugh McDonald replaced Such as bassist unofficaly. The album produced by Peter Collins, was regarded as a much maligned album full of subtle lyrics and deeper references with respect to life today. It was an overall darker album in contrast to the band's usual brand of feel good, inspiring rock songs and love ballads. Along with heightened lyrical development, the group's sound continues to evolve away from the usual pop-metal fare. Jon Bon Jovi occassionally drifts into a raspy voice, while David Bryan's keyboard playing veers from the lush orchestration of &quot;Lie To Me&quot; to a simpler harpsichord tone in &quot;If That's What It Takes.&quot; Still, Bon Jovi remain a guitar-driven band, and Richie Sambora's muscular style has expanded to include some tasty electric-sitar playing.\nBon Jovi's characters on These Days weigh in with more mature and darker conflicts than those explored on previous albums. On &quot;Hey God,&quot; a family man on the brink of homelessness cries out for spiritual guidance. The title track goes a step further, describing the sheer hopelessness that goes with not having a place to live. Other characters who've lost their way are either on quests of faith (&quot;Something To Believe In&quot;) or have found other altars to worship at (&quot;Something For The Pain&quot;).\nThese Days was a huge commercial success, specially in the Japan and the European markets. In the UK the album was largely anticipated, and it had replaced Michael Jackson's album HIStory at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spent four consecutive weeks at #1. These Days holds the record for the band to spawn the most Top 10 singles, with four singles charting on the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart (&quot;This Ain't a Love Song&quot;, &quot;Something for the Pain&quot;, &quot;Lie to Me&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot;). The album also topped the European Albums Chart for seven weeks and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry certified &quot;These Days&quot; three times platinum, denoting three million shipments within the continent. In 1995, the album was ranked number 2 on Q magazine's list of the Top 50 albums of 1995. In 2006 the album featured in the Classic Rock &amp; Metal Hammer 's The 200 Greatest Albums Of The 90's. In the United States, the album was received with lukewarm success. These Days spun only one hit single in United States. This Ain't A Love Song reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the album debuted at #9 on the Billboard 200, it slipped down the charts very quickly, and in all it just sold over one million copies in United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7686698b8a4c74524c69886c58870ffc1503fa03","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+These+Days+%281995%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage.Scambioe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7686698b8a4c74524c69886c58870ffc1503fa03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,134,105,139,138,76,116,82,76,105,136,108,88,135,15,252,21,3,250,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
