It springs rather from my conviction that, if our civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢- Karl Popper, from the Preface\n \nWritten in political exile during the Second World War and first published in two volumes in 1945, Karl PopperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Open Society and Its Enemies is one of the most influential books of all time. Hailed by Bertrand Russell as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœvigorous and profound defence of democracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, its now legendary attack on the philosophies of Plato, Hegel and Marx exposed the dangers inherent in centrally planned political systems and through underground editions become an inspiration to lovers of freedom living under communism in Eastern Europe.\n PopperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly accessible style, his erudite and lucid explanations of the thoughts of great philosophers and the recent resurgence of totalitarian regimes around the world are just three of the reasons for the enduring popularity of The Open Society and Its Enemies and why it demands to be read today and in years to come.\n\n2011 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cf69ec6879f7ca287f2a0d33e825ac1f461026","amp;dn":"The+Open+Society+and+Its+Enemies+%28Popper%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cf69ec6879f7ca287f2a0d33e825ac1f461026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,207,105,236,104,121,247,202,40,127,42,13,51,232,37,172,31,70,16,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
