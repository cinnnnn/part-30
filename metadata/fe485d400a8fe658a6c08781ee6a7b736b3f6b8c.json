For those who prefer flac files, converting from ape is no problem: lossless to lossless = lossless. Most media players will do this, I use MediaMonkey. Standalone converters exist, also.I use xrecode. Any computer from the last 5 years can convert to the format of your choice in a matter of minutes (or less) for each CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe485d400a8fe658a6c08781ee6a7b736b3f6b8c","amp;dn":"Mercury+Living+Presence+Collection+%2821-30%29+%5Bape%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe485d400a8fe658a6c08781ee6a7b736b3f6b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,72,93,64,10,143,230,88,166,192,135,129,238,106,123,115,107,63,107,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
