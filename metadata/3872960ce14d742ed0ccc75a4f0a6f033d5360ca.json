Some are terrified. Some are predicting cosmic doom on the near horizon. Others are making astonishing predictions. What does the Bible really say?\n\nEschatology (the Study of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last ThingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is among the most challenging avenues of study, even for the most sophisticated.\n\n   -What are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ End Time events?\n   -What is the most preposterous doctrine in Christianity?\n   -Does the Church go through the Great Tribulation?\n   -Which Kingdom do we pray for in the LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prayer?\n   -Is there really a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Battle of ArmageddonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Why?\n   -What Scripture did Jesus deliberately leave out in Nazareth?\n   -Who is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“AntiChristÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Is he alive today?\n   -Should we expect a literal Babylon on the horizon?\n\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3872960ce14d742ed0ccc75a4f0a6f033d5360ca","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+End+Times+Scenario+-+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3872960ce14d742ed0ccc75a4f0a6f033d5360ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,114,150,12,225,77,116,46,208,204,199,90,79,10,111,3,61,83,96,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
