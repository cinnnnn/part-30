It provides information and useful tools for DVD media. Both DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW types are supported. It follows in the tradition of DVDInfo, my first dvd application that was very successful. This new version is a result of listening to users criticisms, requests and suggestions, and applying this to the new version. The program is compatible with Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, Windows 2000 and XP. Windows 95, 98 and ME require that Aspi drivers be already installed.\n\nThis program provides information &amp; tools for:\n* Blu-ray and HD-DVD\n* DVD-R/RW\n* DVD+R/RW burners\n* DVD-R DL (Double Layer) burners\n* DVD+R DL (Double Layer) burners\n* DVD-ROM players.\n\nOS : Win XP/2000/Vista/Win 7\nLanguage : English\n\n\n\nHome Page - http://www.dvdinfopro.com/\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d6dd31ec46fc0ba63bc0e8a9ff9c19771eb753","amp;dn":"DVDInfoPro+Xtreme+v6.528.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d6dd31ec46fc0ba63bc0e8a9ff9c19771eb753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,214,221,49,236,70,252,11,166,59,192,232,169,255,156,25,119,30,183,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
