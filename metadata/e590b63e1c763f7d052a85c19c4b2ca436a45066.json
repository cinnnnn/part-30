On ten standards Brubeck, altoist Paul Desmond and the Quartet fit in perfectly behind the great swing/blues singer Jimmy Rushing who sounds rejuvenated by the fresh setting. This disc, a surprising success, is well worth searching for. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nThis is how i came about. One day, out of the blue, Jimmy said &quot; Dave, let's do an album together, you and me. &quot; Dave agreed, but nothing more was said about the project until several months had passed. Dave had some reservations about it; he wasn't sure that his group could offer the right setting for Jimmy. Also, various engagements kept their paths from crossing. Then while everyone was in Europe on jazz concert tours - Dave with the Quartet, Jimmy with the Buck Clayton All-Stars - the subject came up again. &quot; Let's make that album when we get back to the States, &quot; said Jimmy. &quot; Okay, &quot; Dave replied, &quot; but do you really think we can play the right background for you? &quot; &quot; I know it, &quot;  Jimmy answered. &quot; I've been listening to you for years, and I know we can make a great album. &quot; So they got together in a studio and recorded this collection, a spontaneous explosion of jazz. Dave and Jimmy have never worked together before, nor ever rehearsed together. What came about is the meeting of two main movements in jazz-one of the most exciting albums I have ever heard. Everybody swings, as Dave and Jimmy both bring out the best in each other ~ Teo Macero ( from original liner notes )\n\nPersonnel:\nJimmy Rushing ( Vocals ) \nDave Brubeck ( Piano ) \nPaul Desmond ( Alto Saxophone ) \nEugene Wright ( Double Bass ) \nJoe Morello ( Drums ) \n\nDave Brubeck Quartet &amp; Jimmy Rushing Tracks:\n01  There'll Be Some Changes Made ( Billy Higgins/W.
