and\nand throw that on any flash drive to use on any protected computers.\n\n - there are some computers out there that are so locked down that unless you rename\nthe file to something the computer already allows, even portable programs won't work.\nif you do find yourself in this situation, all you need to do is rename the files to\niexplorer.exe, because almost every public computer allows that one to run. \n\n\n________________________________\nHOWEVER:\n\n - DON'T ever rename the file &quot;_Microsoft Office 2003 MultiLang - do not rename.dat.&quot;\n\n - this DAT is what contains all of the programs - the other files are just shorcuts.\n\n - if the DAT file is renamed, none of the programs will work until its changed back.\n\n - since the rest of the filenames are just shorcuts, you can edit them all you want.\n\n\n________________________________\nTHE TEMP FOLDER AKA THE SANDBOX:\n\n - DON'T delete the contents of the directory &quot;temp folder(sandbox) - do not delete.&quot;\n\n - this folder will be generated as soon as you have run one of the office programs.\n\n - this folder retains any changes made to the portable program's config / settings.\n\n - if you accidentally delete this folder, it's okay because it will be regenerated.\n\n - if the program ever stops working, then go and delete the folder or its contents.\n\n - since deleting the folder or its contents will revert the program to its original\nsettings, if it is important to you to never have to reconfigure settings, make sure\nto export your config with the &quot;Microsoft Office 2003 Save My Settings Wizard.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nENJOY\n-The11thMtnDiv\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb68a827ed9ee4ff5e0b365996b1e05fd924624b","amp;dn":"Office+2003+Pro+Portable+11in1+SP2+MultiLang+-+The11thMtnDiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb68a827ed9ee4ff5e0b365996b1e05fd924624b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,104,168,39,237,158,228,255,94,11,54,89,150,177,224,95,217,36,98,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
