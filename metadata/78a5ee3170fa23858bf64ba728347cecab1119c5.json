Hoar's shocking book Handouts and Pickpockets - Our Government Gone Berserk (1996) which goes to great lengths in explaining the extent of &quot;Big Brother's&quot; power within the American political system. Each day in America, people are conned and victimized by their own government - the very government created to serve them. Handouts and Pickpockets chronicles the shameful, un-American policies and practices of the once-glorious republic, now reduced to an overgrown, autocratic Nanny state. But, even more appalling is Hoar's finding that this decline was not accidental, but planned. 200 pages. A must read for everyone.
