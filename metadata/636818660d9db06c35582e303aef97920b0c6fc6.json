Christensen and Mark Seifert\nPenciler:  Richard Pollard\nInker:  David Mowry\nLetterers:  Mark Craig and Mark Seifert\nCover Artists:  Richard Pollard, Inferno Studios, and C' Digital Imaging\n\nAbandoned by those who were chosen to protect her and forced to spend her immortal existence among the madding crowds of humanity, Twilight is endowed with the powers of both Zeus, the ruler of the Greek pantheon of gods, and a demon. As she searches for a purpose among the mortals, she runs afoul of various entities who would use her Olympian- and devil-spawned abilities for their own ends. Deciding that she can trust no one, Twilight leads the solitary life of one who is not fully god, demon, or human.\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
