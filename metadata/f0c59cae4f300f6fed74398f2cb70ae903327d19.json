Born in Syracuse, NY, Ed Hamell spent years as a member of many bands before venturing into the realm of the solo singer-songwriter. \n\n&quot;I've been living with this album for the best part of two years now and it still makes me smile, swear and furrow my brow in wonder at how one man and one guitar can sound so loud every single time I listen to it. I buy this album for my friends as birthday and Christmas presents so that there will be more of us who can talk about Bobby, Chooch, Nancy, Joe Brush and the rest of the characters that provide the back-bone of what is an essential album. Indeed quotes from songs have been littering our conversation for a while now with our particular favourite coming from &quot;When Bobby Comes Down&quot;\n\nWords and characters that litter Hamell's Mean Streets of New York are easily reflected in British cities from Brighton to Bradford. The ever-present undercurrent of drink, drugs, sex and violence make this a vital album full of memorable punk/accoustic tracks full of &quot;that Geezer must have 8 fingers to pull that off&quot; guitar. I've seen him live and I intend to do so again. And Again.\n\nYou will never tire of this album. You may forget it for a few months. You may even lend it to a CD stealing friend. But you will return to Choochtown, just like a favourite bar, town or holiday destination&quot;. \n\n01. Go Fuck Yourself  \n02. When Bobby Comes Down  \n03. Hamell's Ramble  \n04.
