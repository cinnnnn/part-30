Through Faith is how all Christians are saved yet most Christians are of different denominations with differing Faith's! This highlights the biggest problem affecting Christian's today. We are commanded to be of &quot;One Faith&quot;, so whay are most Christians so varied in &quot;Faith&quot;? Seldonly preached correctly from the pulpit, learn what the Christian faith is and what should it embody for salvation. This sermon is highly recommended for all. God bless.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIdentity Crisis - Passion for Truth Ministries:\r\nDiscover Your True Biblical Identity.  There is a supernatural awakening happening in these last days! Christians around the world have been given a divine invitation from the Holy Spirit to come back to the roots of their faith. Like the prodigal son, Godâ€™s people are returning home to their Father, leaving behind the doctrines and denominations of man, and embracing their true identity!\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Solomon, the nation of Israel was split into two kingdoms. Both of these kingdoms were exiled into the nations because of their disobedience, but only oneâ€”the southern Kingdomâ€”maintained its identity and returned to the land. What happened to the northern Kingdom? Where are the lost tribes? Now, with the advent of Christ, does it even matter? Has Israel been replaced by â€œthe church?â€ Is God no longer the God of Israel? Finally, how do Gentile Believers fit in to all of this?\r\n\r\nYou might be surprised to discover just how relevant these pressing questions are to your own life. Join us in this newly updated and extended teaching as we explore one of the most incredible prophetic events in the Bible! The time is now for Godâ€™s people to connect to the true roots of their Christian faith and return home. Do you hear the call?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDavid Wilkerson - Moving Your Mountain:\r\nThe mountain we must move is unbelief. Unbelief grieves the heart of God and causes Him pain. God does not wink at unbelief. There is a series of agonies we will go through that leads to a place where we pray the ultimate prayer.\r\n\r\nThe place is Gethsemane. After fasting, prayer and weeping we will cry just as Jesus cried, &quot;Not my will but thy will be done.&quot;\r\nThe victory comes when we are absolutely convinced of the love of God.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nStop Trusting Manâ€™s Word:\r\nIn this presentation, Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis discusses the problems with falsely interpretating God's word in scripture and embracing man's ideas or explanations as if they are, should be or even falsify the gospel while using the Genesis creation as the primary example. We need to let God say what He means and not man. When we need help in inderstanding what God is telling us, we need to let Him describe what He means as written in the Bible -- look internally to the Word, and not use outside explanations or reasoing like science or scholars in general. Either we FULLY trust in God and His infallible Word or we trust more in man -- placing man on a higher pedestal over God. We cannot make the Bible conform to us, we must conform to it. All trust begins and ends with God and His holy word. Christians need to start thinking within the confines of God's perspective and not from man's. And that's been an accelerating problem for the Christian community of recent times which will eventually lead to the upcoming Great &quot;Falling Away&quot; as prophesied in the bible. We need to start testing all things as God commanded us to do, placing the bible first in authority and fully trusting in His word, then test all scripture and all of man's supposed truth to it. If a contradiction ever apprears, then the problem rests in man's interpretation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e30a0f812448f2b5a3a6d4620920ad16d6e5914d","amp;dn":"The+Bible+-+Walking+By+Faith+pt5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e30a0f812448f2b5a3a6d4620920ad16d6e5914d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,10,15,129,36,72,242,181,163,166,212,98,9,32,173,22,214,229,145,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
