Well, he's done it again, only all by himself this time. Writing, producing, singing, and playing nearly everything except the occasional guitar overdub (and strings), Jason has released a one-man pop tour de force. Hooks abound and won't let you down. The more you listen, the more you'll find yourself humming along. Standout tracks include &quot;I Go Astray&quot; and &quot;Don't Show Me Heaven,&quot; but all are worthy of a listen. It's good ol' pop music. Better still, it's good music. (4.5/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9174bf2ccab397d3f1ef8bdeb1683b18d144bcde","amp;dn":"Jason+Falkner+-+Presents+Author+Unknown+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9174bf2ccab397d3f1ef8bdeb1683b18d144bcde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,116,191,44,202,179,151,211,241,239,139,222,177,104,59,24,209,68,188,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
