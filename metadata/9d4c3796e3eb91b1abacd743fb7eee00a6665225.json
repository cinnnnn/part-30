She is held captive in\nthe floating city of Columbia in alternate version of 1912. During his travels\nBooker encounters different factions within the city who are battling one\nanother. The Founders want Columbia to remain a city only for pure Americans\nwhile the Vox Populi think the city should be available to anyone. The setting\nis built around the idea of exceptionalism with a strong religious doctrine\nand open racism. Elizabeth is a key piece within this conflict and has a\nmysterious origin including her powers to cause tears in the fabric of space-\ntime, exposingparallel universes. Booker and Elizabeth remain together most of\nthe game and she acts on her own. She does not need to be defended, tosses\nammo and silver eagle coins to Booker and can be asked to pick locks. They are\nhunted down by the spiritual leader Comstock and his troops, along with the\ngiant mechanical Songbird.\n\nThe game uses similar gameplay styles and mechanics found in previous BioShock\ngames. Vigors give the player super powers to do a variety of things such as\nsending a murder of crows to peck away enemies or charming enemies to defend\nyou. Another one is possession used to take over humans or machines to\ntemporarily turn them into allies. Once the effect wears off, the possessed\nhumans will commit suicide. Most vigors have multiple uses either as a direct\nattack or as a much stronger trap awaiting to be triggered. Booker can also be\nupgraded through four types of gear with permanent bonuses similar to the gene\ntonics in the previous games. Different types can be equipped according to the\nsituation. The typical FPS array of weapons can be found throughout the game\nlike pistols, shotguns, and rifles. One of the more notable weapons is the Sky\nHook which can be used as a melee weapon to take down an enemy. Money can be\nexchanged at vending machines for upgrades and consumables. Items are found by\nlooting barrels, desks and enemies. Vigors can only be executed when a\nsufficient amount of salt has been collected. The three main bars visible on\nthe screen (health, salt and shield) can be extended by locating and using\ninfusions. The story is also furthered through optional voxophones (audio logs)\nand kinetoscopes (film projectors).\n\nSkylines provide a unique way to move throughout the world. Using the Sky Hook,\nthe player can attached to these lines and quickly slide in one direction or\nanother. These can be used to escape overwhelming situations or used to reach\nhigher ground to gain a combat edge.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Installation notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
