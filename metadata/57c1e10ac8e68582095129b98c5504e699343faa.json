WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got time for all that angsty dating crap when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a new dance studio to run? Then sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given a piece of wulfenite crystal and Lord Wulfenite, Keeper of the Shifting Sands fief, literally pops out of the crystal and plants one on her. Wulf is the man of her dreamsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or at least, dressed like an ad for We Love Leather, with killer abs and delectable pectorals, he sure looks like the man of her dreams. But if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing ChalceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned: If it looks too good to be true, then it sure as heck probably is too good to be true! And Wulf proves to be no exception.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57c1e10ac8e68582095129b98c5504e699343faa","amp;dn":"The+Crystal+Warrior.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57c1e10ac8e68582095129b98c5504e699343faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,193,225,10,200,230,133,130,9,81,41,185,140,85,4,230,153,52,63,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
