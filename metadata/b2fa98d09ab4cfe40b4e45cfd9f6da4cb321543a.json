Ruth hand-milks a local breed of cow and discovers how the railways came to the rescue when a deadly disease wiped out almost the entire stock of London cattle.\r\n\r\nAfter undergoing an eyesight test, Victorian-style, Peter joins the footplate crew on the South Devon line. But it is not all plain sailing when it comes to driving the milk train through the night. We meet Dave Knowling, a steam-engine driver of 63 years' experience, who shows Peter how it is done and why it is so important to keep one eye closed when shovelling coal. Working on the Victorian railways was dangerous - 500 lost their lives and 16,000 were injured in one year alone. Ruth discovers those who lost a limb on the Great Western Railway were catered for by a special prosthetic limbs workshop.\r\n\r\nAlex and Peter take a trip to Strathspey Railway and find out about one of Scotland's most lucrative exports, while at the Gwili Line, Ruth finds out why a young, Welsh entrepreneur became the first person to introduce mail order catalogues - thanks to the railways.\r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 18 August 2016\r\nDuration: 59 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Info:\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media\r\nCodec ID : isom (isom/iso2/avc1/mp41)\r\nFile size : 1 015 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 0s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 404 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 2 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 59mn 0s\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 305 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.100\r\nStream size : 973 MiB (96%)\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 58mn 59s\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nFrame rate : 46.875 fps (1024 spf)\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 39.4 MiB (4%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2fa98d09ab4cfe40b4e45cfd9f6da4cb321543a","amp;dn":"Full+Steam+Ahead+-+S01E05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2fa98d09ab4cfe40b4e45cfd9f6da4cb321543a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,250,152,208,154,180,207,228,11,78,69,207,217,246,218,76,179,33,84,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
