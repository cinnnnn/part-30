Leading researchers review widely used therapies for alcoholism, infantile autism, ADHD, and posttraumatic stress disorder; herbal remedies for depression and anxiety; suggestive techniques for memory recovery; and self-help models. Other topics covered include issues surrounding psychological expert testimony, the uses of projective assessment techniques, and unanswered questions about dissociative identity disorder. Providing knowledge to guide truly accountable mental health practice, the volume also imparts critical skills for designing and evaluating psychological research programs. It is ideal for use in advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in clinical psychology, psychotherapy, and evidence-based practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e8e0cab87d3b6370ce31c4db609e4eb55d7940","amp;dn":"Science+and+Pseudoscience+in+Clinical+Psychology+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e8e0cab87d3b6370ce31c4db609e4eb55d7940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,232,224,202,184,125,59,99,112,206,49,196,219,96,158,78,181,93,121,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
