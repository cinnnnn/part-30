Only trouble is he believes that the loving neighbor couple (Mare Winningham, David Andrews) and their two children (Noah Fleiss, Chelsea Russo) are to blame for them leaving by filling his wife's head with nonsense. He then sets out to discipline the family for their failings. But when the couple reports him to the police, the police will not believe the couple because of the fireman's status in the community. Things escalate until he kills a repairman (Keone Young), then the police (John Ratzenbereger, Dawnn Lewis) and finally launches a totally terroristic attack on the family including again playing Russian Roulette with them.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118670/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118670/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538807e81a296712b8fc354fedc770f8b6fc1e01","amp;dn":"Bad.Day.On.The.Block.1997.DVDRiP.SVCD.SWESUB-DUPVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538807e81a296712b8fc354fedc770f8b6fc1e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,136,7,232,26,41,103,18,184,252,53,79,237,199,112,248,182,252,30,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
