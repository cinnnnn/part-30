Are mantras just meaningless words? Does saying &quot;want&quot; keep you from having? What about words used in prayer? How do the specific words we use affect what we attract?\nTough to love? Drinking, drugs, broken curfews . . . &quot;A lot of my life revolves around a difficult 19-year old daughter who's had a difficult path.&quot; A few pointers from Infinite Intelligence.\nTick Tock? The nature of time; aging; the universe expanding . . . linear time for timeless beings. Abraham helps us get a handle on &quot;the perception of time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ slowing time down, and &quot;walking through tomorrow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ today.&quot;\nTHE Book: How do the teachings of Abraham jive with traditional Christianity . . . or with any religion, for that matter? With an amusing &quot;early days&quot; tale of Jerry and Esther somehow finding themselves on a &quot;Bible-belt&quot; phone-in radio show!\nCan The Law of Attraction be scientifically proven? A more detailed analysis of &quot;The Law.&quot; And how do emotion and matter interact to attract?\nAnd much much more . . . Answers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham -- whom Esther Hicks calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry Hicks refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered&quot;.\n\n\nThis torrent is from the Abraham-Hicks Torrent Community.

But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\nLouise Hay calls them &quot;some of the best teachers on the planet today.&quot;\n\nTo Dr. Wayne Dyer they are &quot;the great Masters of the Universe!&quot;\n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.\n\nAbraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self.\n\nCheck out Abraham for yourself. It's the only way to go and the only way to know.\n\nAnd finallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from JerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Mr. Practical&quot;: &quot;I don't know what they are and I don't care what they are. I'm just using them for the good it will do for myself and others.&quot;\n\n\nJerry and Esther never used the word channeling, because it means many things of which they are not. You don't call the magnificent master musician a channeler, but he is. He's channeling the broader essence of who he is into the specifics of what he is about.\n\nJerry and Esther deliver an inspirational message of joy and well-being. They travel to over forty cities every year, offering workshops where participants direct their questions to Abraham and learn ways to achieve all that is desired in life.\n\n&quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot; is the original source material for the current Law of Attraction wave that is sweeping the world, and it is the 21st century inspiration for thousands of books, films, essays and lectures that are responsible for the current paradigm shift in consciousness.\n\nHere at www.abraham-hicks.com you will find accurate clarification of the basics of the Law of Attraction and practical applications as well as up-to-the-moment leading-edge expanding information regarding the Law of Attraction. (Also known as &quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot;) This is the fountainhead of the information upon which the hit movie, &quot;The Secret&quot; was based.\n\nLaw of Attraction says, &quot;That which is like unto itself is drawn.&quot; Everything is valid and everything is truthful, because Law of Attraction lets everything be. The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.\n\nThank you to all who participated to make this possible!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:846c9c9fea603d950ceab9c13738babb8bfd93c9","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+Law+Of+Attraction+In+Action+EP01+VOB+2DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"846c9c9fea603d950ceab9c13738babb8bfd93c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,108,156,159,234,96,61,149,12,234,185,193,55,56,186,187,139,253,147,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
