In a small park near the river, Alex sleeps on a bench. When he awakens, we can see that he's a mess. He is coming off a colossal bender. As he stirs, a book falls out of his coat: a high school yearbook. He flips through the pages and finds himself. &quot;Alex Kalienka: Alex likes watching T.V., drawing cartoons, and doing nothing. Future places: Sunny California and Mickey Walt Cartoon Studios.&quot; Alex closes the book and vomits in the river.\n\nAlex is the story of failed dreams and the consequences faced by a man who discovers that accomplishing his career goals are no route to inner peace. It is a story about the redemptive power of art, and about how fleeting those chances for redemption can be in a society that emphasizes different values.\n\nThis existential, 250-page exploration of depression and the healing power of art was originally published over ten years ago as a six-issue comic book series and is collected here as one book for the first time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770307abc5309595c61c9af18fca1254bda9ef49","amp;dn":"Mark+Kalesniko+-+Alex+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770307abc5309595c61c9af18fca1254bda9ef49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,3,7,171,197,48,149,149,198,28,154,241,143,202,18,84,189,169,239,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
