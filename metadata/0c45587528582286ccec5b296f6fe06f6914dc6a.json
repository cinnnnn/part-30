He then got a job during World War II as a replacement guitarist with the Stars Over Texas Bond Drive. Hale had joined with several Republic Pictures celebrities and staff.[citation needed]\n\nWhen signing to the company for seven years, he changed his name from Buren Ely to Monte Hale. He soon starred in his first major role in Home on the Range (1946 film). During his film run in the early 1950s, he began to sing at rodeos and circuses. He soon retired from movies and began to appear at western conventions. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.[3]\n\nOn November 12, 2004, for his work in movies, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was also instrumental in the foundation of what is now the Autry National Center of the American West\n\n\n\nPublished by Charlton Comics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Comics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c45587528582286ccec5b296f6fe06f6914dc6a","amp;dn":"Monte+Hale+Western+%7B1956+Complete+Series+-+Golden+Age%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c45587528582286ccec5b296f6fe06f6914dc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,69,88,117,40,88,34,134,204,236,91,41,111,111,224,111,105,20,220,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
