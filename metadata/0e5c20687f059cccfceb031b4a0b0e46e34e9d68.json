The specter of nuclear warfare loomed large over the real Cold War, but mutually assured destruction (MAD) was the last resort as all knew that the first one to start nuclear hostilities would end up wiped out just the same. In this alternative history of the Cold War, Europe is the core of a war that very well could have been!\n\nWargame: European Escalation features intense real-time battles, stunning graphics, and the amazing IRISZOOMÃ¢â€žÂ¢ system, giving you a continuous zoom from a global view of the map to the very heart of the action.
