It offers all the expected newsreader functionality: easy-to-navigate threaded discussions, the ability to ignore annoying posters, multiple signature management, and easy, Mail-like posting with spell checking and all the trimmings\n\nBut it also goes much, much further than any other Usenet client on earth, starting with a unique four-view interface that lets you view and work with Usenet group content in four distinct styles: messages, files, images, or music. It lets you preview MP3 files directly off a Usenet server, view images in an elegant iPhoto-like thumbnail view, prioritize transfers with a flexible downloads manager, find favorites quickly with a categorized column-view interface, smartly group files into meta-groups (like songs into albums), show download status beautifully in the dock, and much more.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nMac OS X 10.5 or later. \n\nCrack is included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14001a6524b4c54e6a184ec47ab576d19861bc49","amp;dn":"Unison+2.1.8+%5BK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14001a6524b4c54e6a184ec47ab576d19861bc49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,0,26,101,36,180,197,78,106,24,78,196,122,181,118,209,152,97,188,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
