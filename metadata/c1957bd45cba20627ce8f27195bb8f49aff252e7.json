If youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re in a party thereÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s no team damage though.\nAll player drops are persistent now.  So if you accidentally throw your diamond drill down a mineshaft, you donÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t have to suicide trying to get it back before it disappears.\nNew Monster attacks (gravity slam! gust attacks! other stuff!)\nFixed Legendary Weapons damage (adjusted up to be moreÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª wellÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª Legendary.)\nWeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve put in new Techs (such as a Glitch Mech).\nNew biome type enabled.  Savannah.\nBoss Lore!\nNo more eating bandages and stims, they have their own thing now.\nBetter, more featureful .abc file support, and we have Wanderlust music in the game now.  (Thanks Leth and D2!)\nMade NPC chatter more configurable and slightly more varied.\nAdded new objects (such as lava biome treasure chests).\nAdded new items (like nightsticks and bonesaws).\nSword swooshes are only active for 0.6 seconds instead of 0.9 seconds.\nMaking cooldown times actually matter without slowing down combat.  Also fine tuned their hitboxes.\nViking helmet?  Viking helmet.\nWatch out for landmines.\nVarious changes to treasure drop pools (like Avian Guards actually dropping their gunsÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª)\nMinor tweaks to existing armors to make them look better.\nMedieval Furnace now actually acts like a Furnace. (Rejoice).\nGraphical upgrades to some existing plants, and new plants.\nLots more secret stuff! :OOO\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1957bd45cba20627ce8f27195bb8f49aff252e7","amp;dn":"Starbound+Update+8.1+%28Furious+Koala%29+%2ACracked%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1957bd45cba20627ce8f27195bb8f49aff252e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,149,123,212,92,186,32,98,124,232,242,113,149,187,143,73,175,242,82,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
