It was done awhile back by a source unknown to me apparently encoded from a television broadcast. The quality is decent and watchable, but not A+ for sure. I am sharing it for the content, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a really good film. Hope you like it. \n\nMedia Info:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name: Renegades (1989) Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips TV.avi\nFormat: AVI\nFormat/Info: Audio Video Interleave\nFile size: 686 MiB\nDuration: 1h 37mn\nOverall bit rate: 982 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID: 0\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP: No\nFormat settings, QPel: No\nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix: Default (H.263)\nCodec ID: DX50\nCodec ID/Hint: DivX 5\nDuration: 1h 37mn\nBit rate: 780 Kbps\nWidth: 720 pixels\nHeight: 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 3:2\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nStandard: NTSC\nColor space: YUV\nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0\nBit depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nCompression mode: Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.090\nStream size: 545 MiB (79%)\nWriting library: DivX 5.2.1 (WaffleDay) (UTC 2004-09-0\n\nAudio\nID: 1\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nCodec ID: 55\nCodec ID/Hint: MP3\nDuration: 1h 37mn\nBit rate mode: Constant\nBit rate: 192 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode: Lossy\nDelay relative to video: 26ms\nStream size: 134 MiB (20%)\nAlignment: Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration: 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nTitle: Audio Stream\n\nMUCH Peace n luv to my friends at 1337x and blazinseedboxes\n\n\nENJOY!!\n\n**tyvm and all due respect to the original uploader all those who care enough to share\n\n\nTorrent originally uploaded by kawliga55\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dbc7e18f468f4c26132b9463f3f6ec296b98ba2","amp;dn":"Renegades+%281989%29+Kiefer+Sutherland+Lou+Diamond+PhillipsT+avi%5BDiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dbc7e18f468f4c26132b9463f3f6ec296b98ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,188,126,24,244,104,244,194,97,50,185,70,63,63,110,194,150,185,139,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
