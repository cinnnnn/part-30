Her book, The Thinking Body, described new ways to use all the senses as well as inner feeling and imagination to retrain the body to move with ease and balance. The system became an invaluable tool for generations of dancers, actors, and performance artists, thanks largely to one of its most important teachers, AndrÃƒÂ© Bernard (1924-2003). This book presents an introduction to the practice as well as a lengthy interview with Bernard and two meticulously detailed workshop protocols illustrated with 52 photographs and line drawings.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface by Wolfgang Steinmiiller\nSuggestions on How to Use This Book\nAcknowledgments\nPART 1: Introduction to the Work\nAn Introduction to Ideokinesis by AndrÃƒÂ© Bernard\nInterview with AndrÃƒÂ© Bernard by Richard Rosen and Nancy Lyons\nIdeokinesis: A Source of Inspiration by Ursula Strieker\nPART 2: Workshops with AndrÃƒÂ© Bernard\nAn Adventure into Your Own Being: First Day of the Introductory Workshop\nSitting and Standing: Second Day of the Introductory Workshop\nFrom Shoulders to Feet: Third Day of the Introductory Workshop\nAxis and Balance: First Day of the Advanced Workshop\nSurprise Your Nervous System: Second Day of the Advanced Workshop\nEpilogue by Nancy Lyons\nAbout the Authors\n\nAbout the Author\nAndrÃƒÂ© Bernard was raised in Columbia, South Carolina.
