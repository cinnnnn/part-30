Under six headings (annals, genealogies, poems, prose tracts and sagas, legal material, colophons and marginalia), it discusses not only the nature of the sources themselves, the purposes for which they were originally created, and their survival and availability to researchers, but also how to glean usable historical information from them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da553ee7288baeb02e49257a08e7a4cc8477dfe","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Medieval+Gaelic+Sources+%28Maynooth+Research+Guides+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da553ee7288baeb02e49257a08e7a4cc8477dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,165,83,238,114,136,186,235,2,228,146,87,160,142,122,76,200,71,125,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
