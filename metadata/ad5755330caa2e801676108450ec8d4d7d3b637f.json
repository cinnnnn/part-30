This is not the 1928 version.  I&amp;#039;m still trying to find that one.\n\nThe story is about the young fliers 1915 in the Great War (WWI).  The dialog is typical of the late 20s early 30s.  It shows the agony of spirit of innocent young men at war for whom the glory is gone.  It also shows the guilt of officers that care.  This is a must have.\n\nFull screen, black and white, dvd rip, avi, this is very good quality considering how old the original was.  You will like it.  English only, no subs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0020815/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0020815/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5755330caa2e801676108450ec8d4d7d3b637f","amp;dn":"The+Flight+Commander+-+1930.Howard+Hawks.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5755330caa2e801676108450ec8d4d7d3b637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,87,85,51,12,170,46,128,22,118,16,132,80,236,141,77,125,59,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
