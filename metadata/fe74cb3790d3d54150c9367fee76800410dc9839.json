Version 7.1 adds even more features without making the app any more complex to use.\n\nThe feature-packed screencast app--which includes HD production settings--does have a learning curve, but the user-friendly interface and front-and-center icons for most-used tools go a long way toward lowering the intimidation factor a notch. Plus, TechSmith povides a useful online help center that includes several video tutorials that do a nice job walking users through the main functionality of the software.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe74cb3790d3d54150c9367fee76800410dc9839","amp;dn":"Camtasia+Studio+7.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe74cb3790d3d54150c9367fee76800410dc9839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,116,203,55,144,211,213,65,80,201,54,127,238,118,128,4,16,220,152,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
