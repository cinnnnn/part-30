They refrain from characteristic pogo-bouncing anthems for their own quirky post-punk and energetic live shows, influencing a new school of emo/punk bands along the way. The first incarnation of Saves the Day happened when singer/songwriter Chris Conley was only 13, and the band was first called Indifference and, later, Seffler. A name change to their current moniker, taken from a lyric from the Farside song &quot;Hero,&quot; came with the recording of their first demo. Conley (vocals), Eben D'Amico (bass), Ted Alexander (guitar), David Soloway (guitar), and Bryan Newman (drums) made their debut with 1997's Can't Slow Down on Equal Vision Records, though D'Amico didn't join the lineup until after this album. Recorded during winter break of their high-school senior year, the record featured production work from Steve Evetts (Sepultura, Dillinger Escape Plan, Sick of It All).\n...\n \nIn Reverie, the band's first for DreamWorks and with new drummer Pete Parada, followed two years later. Vagrant issued Ups &amp; Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides in August 2004, an album that contained exactly what the title states. The band re-signed with Vagrant in early 2006 and officially welcomed new bassist Manny Carrero into its ranks. Sound the Alarm followed that April, which of course meant tour dates through the rest of the year, including dates on that summer's Warped Tour. Parada made his exit in March 2007 and was replaced soon enough by ex-Classic Case/Glassjaw drummer Durijah Lang. Later that year, Saves the Day released Under the Boards, the second of their three-album concept that began with Sound the Alarm. Before they could finish the trio, Saves the Day would almost completely change their lineup, with Soloway, Lang, and Carrero leaving the band. Conley brought in bassist Rodrigo Palma, guitarist Arun Bali, and drummer Claudio Rivera to bolster the ranks, and went back into the studio in 2009 to begin work on a new album. Saves the Day shopped the completed album around and eventually signed on with Razor &amp; Tie, and in 2011 released their seventh album, Daybreak.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab326a8d63a7972014f13c53732f3b194ba1115f","amp;dn":"Saves+the+Day+-+Discography+%281998-2011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab326a8d63a7972014f13c53732f3b194ba1115f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,50,106,141,99,167,151,32,20,241,60,83,115,47,59,25,75,161,17,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
