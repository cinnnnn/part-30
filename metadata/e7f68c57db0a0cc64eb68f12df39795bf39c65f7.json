This instalment is a contemporary tribute to the Bossa nova sound, especially the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. This release has proven to be one of the Red Hot series' more successful projects, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for AIDS charities around the world.\n\nBrazilian recording artists including Jobim, Astrud Gilberto and Gilberto Gil are among the contributors to the project. Along with them, many contemporary pop music performers are featured on this release, including Incognito, David Byrne, Sting and PM Dawn.\n\nNow this is an interesting project; Brazilian standards and newly-composed music interpreted or transfigured by the old masters, rock stars and cutting-edge '90s musicians - with all the proceeds going to fight the spread of AIDS. What is so remarkable about this album is how wholeheartedly the younger musicians relate to the cruising Brazilian ethos, often without taking the edge off their own idioms. That results in some delightful surprise teamings; rock's George Michael's astoundingly authentic leap into the spirit of &quot;Desafinado&quot; in tandem with Astrud Gilberto, PM Dawn's fusion with Airto and Floria Purim on &quot;Non-Fiction Burning, &quot;and retro-rock band Stereolab's quirky Moog-laced meeting with the fanciful flute of Herbie Mann on &quot;One Note Samba/Surfboard.&quot; Another high point - singers Cesaria Evora and Caetano Veloso teaming up with Yellow Magic Orchestra keyboardist Ryuichi Sakamoto for a pounding, high-tech yet emotional &quot;E Preciso Perdoar.&quot; One of the most beautiful compositions is also one of the newest; multi-instrumentalist Money Mark's echt-Brazilian &quot;Use Your Head&quot; that leads off the album. There are very few misfires; one is a lame &quot;Aguas de Marco&quot; where the Talking Heads' David Byrne again proves that he shouldn't be let anywhere near Latin music. A few of the tracks are donations made before the project's conception (Milton Nascimento's lovely vocalise &quot;Dancing...&quot;) and there is a touching duet between Antonio Carlos Jobim and Sting on &quot;How Insensitive.&quot; As a final production touch, some of the tracks are separated by brief collages of sound that serve as grungy interludes. Anyone with open ears, an adventurous spirit, and a bent for Brazilian music should sample this album.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1- &quot;Use Your Head (Use A Sua Cabeca)&quot; performed by Money Mark Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n2- &quot;Corcovado&quot; performed by Everything but the Girl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n3- &quot;Desafinado (Off Key)&quot; performed by Astrud Gilberto + George Michael Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n4- &quot;Non-Fiction Burning&quot; performed by PM Dawn with Flora Purim + Airto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n5- &quot;The Boy From Ipanema&quot; performed by Crystal Waters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n6- (Interlude) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:14\n7- &quot;SeguranÃƒÂ§a (Security)&quot; performed by Maxwell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n8- &quot;Ãƒâ€° Preciso Perdoar (You Must Forgive)&quot; performed by CesÃƒÂ¡ria Ãƒâ€°vora + Caetano Veloso + Ryuichi Sakamoto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:01\n9- (Interlude) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:33\n10- &quot;Water to Drink (Ãƒï¿½gua de Beber)&quot; performed by Incognito + Omar + Ana Caram Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n11- &quot;DancingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; performed by Milton Nascimento Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n12- &quot;How Insensitive&quot; performed by Antonio Carlos Jobim + Sting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n13- &quot;Waters of March (Aguas de MarÃƒÂ§o)&quot; performed by David Byrne + Marisa Monte Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n14- (Interlude) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:25\n15- &quot;One Note Samba / Surfboard&quot; performed by Stereolab + Herbie Mann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:18\n16- (Interlude) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:21\n17- &quot;Black Orpheus Dub&quot; performed by Mad Professor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n18- &quot;Maracatu AtÃƒÂ´mico&quot; performed by Chico Science + NaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Zumbi + DJ Soul Slinger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:27\n19- &quot;Sambadrome&quot; performed by Ivo Meirelles + Funk 'n Lata Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:58\n20- &quot;Refazenda (Refarm)&quot; performed by Gilberto Gil Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n21- &quot;Preciso Dizer Que Te Amo&quot; performed by Cazuza + Bebel Gilberto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f68c57db0a0cc64eb68f12df39795bf39c65f7","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+%2B+Rio+Contemporary+tribute+to+the+Bossa+nova+sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f68c57db0a0cc64eb68f12df39795bf39c65f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,246,140,87,219,10,12,198,78,182,143,18,223,57,121,91,243,156,101,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
