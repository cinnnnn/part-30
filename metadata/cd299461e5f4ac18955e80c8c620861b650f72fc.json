Which leaves the single as a mixed bag \n- a good cover and original from Earle, a good original \nfrom the Supersuckers, and a pair of so-so covers. \n\nNot a terrible average, but not a great one, either.\n\n\nArtist  : Steve Earle                          \nAlbum   : Steve Earle and The Supersuckers     \nTracks  : 5                                    \nTime    : 0:13 hours\nBitrate : 192kbps\nSize    : 18MB                                 \nLabel   : Sub Pop Records                       \nReleased: 06/10/1997  \n\n\nTRACK INFORMATION\n     \n01 Creepy Jackalope Eye                           3:06\n02 Angel Is The Devil                             1:48\n03 Before They Make Me Run                        3:50\n04 Creepy Jackalope Eye (Supersuckers)            2:19\n05 Angel Is The Devil (Steve Earle only)          2:10\n\n\n**********************************************************\n\nThis is currently out of print and is only available second hand.
