Cheated out of her loot by a couple of former associates, Bradley (Lowell Sherman) and Gwen (Gwen Lee), Dolly commits a bit of larceny but manages to skip town with her latest victim, Steve Crandall (Johnny Mack Brown), a Southern-fried cement tycoon whom she hastily marries. But Steve turns out to be a pauper, his much vaunted plantation actually belonging to a neighbor, and Dolly's game is up when Brad and Gwen make an unannounced arrival. But Dolly has fallen in love with her poor but hardworking husband and is ready to take her punishment. Steve, meanwhile, convinces a judge to release Dolly into his custody and the lovers are reunited. A Lady of Chance was released with added dialogue scenes but none of them apparently featured Miss Shearer, who instead made her talkie debut in the courtroom melodrama The Trial of Mary Dugan (1929).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------my rip--------------\n\n~~~~~~ A Lady of Chance.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,088,550,912\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:17:29\nFrame Count:....................................111457\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................464\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.379\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1736\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.244&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n*****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
