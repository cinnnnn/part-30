In horror, he listened to their frantic Mayday calls on the ship-to-shore radio, to his mother's cries for mercy--and to the deafening shrieks that answered her back.\n\nNow seventeen, Evan has gone in search of answers to his parents' strange disappearance. The only explanation that makes any sense to him is that they were swallowed up by The She, a legendary sea creature that devours ships. But when Evan's quest for the truth uncovers shocking allegations against his parents, he must deal with the possibility that everything he knows about his family is a lie.\n\nGenre: Mystery Paranormal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd37b6cf49c65f187706b5c1e1a3f81a54fab7b","amp;dn":"The+She+by+Carol+Plum-Ucci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd37b6cf49c65f187706b5c1e1a3f81a54fab7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,211,123,108,244,156,101,241,135,112,107,92,30,26,63,129,165,79,171,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
