Jacob Banks)\n\n  Chase &amp; Status -- consisting of drum'n'bass DJs Saul Milton and Will Kennard -- earned their stripes after remixing the rather questionable Capleton track &quot;Duppy Man&quot; to success in 2005. From there the duo had a few hit club singles -- in 2007 with the double A-sided &quot;Hurt You&quot; b/w &quot;Sell Me Your Soul&quot; and 2008's &quot;Take Me Away&quot; -- that hit the top of the U.K. dance and club charts. A full-length was finally released in 2008. Entitled More Than Alot, it featured appearances from Kano, Takura, and Digga, and was well-received critically; it won a 2009 Drum and Bass Award for Best Album. From there, Milton and Kennard dipped their toes into more pop-oriented production; &quot;End Credits,&quot; a 2009 single featuring Plan B, entered the U.K. Top Ten and led to the 2011 album No More Idols, which featured collaborations with Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah, and Cee-Lo Green. Spending 35 weeks in the U.K. Top 40, No More Idols went on to earn double-platinum status.\n\n  At the beginning of 2012, Chase &amp; Status were nominated for Best British Group at the prestigious Brit Awards -- a first for a drum'n'bass outfit -- yet were beaten to the gong by Coldplay. Not resting on their laurels, they spent 2012 playing live dates at festivals across the U.K. and Europe, including a sub-headline slot at the Download metal festival. As a thank-you to fans for their support, the festival favorite &quot;Big Man&quot; -- featuring vocals from Liam Bailey -- was released at the end of 2012. In 2013, the duo released the single &quot;Lost and Found&quot; featuring Louis M^ttrs, which climbed into the Official U.K. Top Ten chart and landed on their third studio album, Brand New Machine. The 2013 album was a darker effort than previous outings and also featured the '90s rave-flavored single &quot;Count on Me.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df72dbdccde14761ed3d5c2e7c4ab6329e4d0a7","amp;dn":"Chase+%26amp%3B+Status+-+Brand+New+Machine+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df72dbdccde14761ed3d5c2e7c4ab6329e4d0a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,247,45,189,204,222,20,118,30,211,213,194,231,196,171,99,41,228,208,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
