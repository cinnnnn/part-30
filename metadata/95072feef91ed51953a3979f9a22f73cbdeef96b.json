[1975] [Album]\nThis torrent has this release: 1989 - Albert Productions / 465262 2 / Reissue\n\nTracklist:\n01. It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll) [05:16]\n02. Rock 'n' Roll Singer [05:04]\n03. The Jack [05:52]\n04. Live Wire [05:50]\n05. T.N.T. [03:35]\n06. Rocker [02:50]\n07. Can I Sit Next to You Girl [04:12]\n08. High Voltage [04:02]\n09. School Days [05:23]\n\nT.N.T. is the second studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in December 1975. Seven of the album's nine songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Bon Scott. &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; was written by Young &amp; Young, and &quot;School Days&quot; is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song.\n\nIt was originally released on Albert Productions, and was never reissued by another label. However, most of its contents were included on Atlantic Records' High Voltage album, which was released internationally in May 1976.\n\nThis CD was made in the 80's from the same master used for the original 1975 Australian vinyl release.\nIt has the original recording levels with full dynamic range unlike subsequent remastered versions that are too loud!\nIt has the proper full length version of the song High Voltage which had the end rudely faded out on all other releases.\nAC/DC never made an album called High Voltage, it was a compilation of songs released outside of Australia.\nThis is the only true cd version that is the same as the original vinyl or cassette.\n\nEarly AC/DC releases have been torn apart, cobbled together and resold in various territories in such a way that nobody but the Australian consumer can delight in the sheer joy that is listening to albums like TNT from start to finish, as intended by the band. Sure, it lacks the polish and poise of later albums, but it makes up for this with buckets of raw, naked power, and a menacing intensity of a rock band doing it hard on the road, and giving every drop of blood and sweat to their cause.\nWhy, oh why is TNT not available all over the world in it's original form? This is a crime against Rock. It must be addressed.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\nAC/DC - High Voltage (Australian Release) [1975] [Album]\nThis torrent has this release: 1989 - Albert Productions / 465250 2 / Reissue\n\nTracklist:\n01.

Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap [04:13]\n02. Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire) [07:31]\n03. There's Gonna Be Some Rockin [03:18]\n04. Problem Child [05:46]\n05. Squealer [05:27]\n06. Big Balls [02:38]\n07. R.I.P. (Rock in Peace) [03:36]\n08. Ride On [05:53]\n09. Jailbreak [04:41]\n\nFrom Allmusic:\nThere's a real sense of menace to &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,&quot; the title song of AC/DC's third album. More than most of their songs to date, it captured the seething malevolence of Bon Scott, the sense that he reveled in doing bad things, encouraged by the maniacal riffs of Angus and Malcolm Young who provided him with their most brutish rock &amp; roll yet. But for as glorious as the title track was, the entire album served as a call to arms from a group that wanted nothing more than to celebrate the dirtiest, nastiest instincts humans could have, right down to the insurgent anti-authority vibe that runs throughout the record. Take &quot;Big Balls&quot; - sure, it's a dirty joke, but it's a dirty joke with class overthrow in mind. There's a sense on Dirty Deeds that AC/DC is storming the gates - they're problem children sick of waiting around to be a millionaire, so they're gonna make their own money, even if they take down others as they go. That's what gives Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap its supercharged, nervy pulse; there's a real sense of danger to this record, something that can't be hidden beneath the jokes. Maybe that's why the album wasn't released in the US until 1981, after Bon's death, after AC/DC had become millionaires - if it arrived any earlier, it would have been too insurrectionist for the common good.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\nAC/DC - Let There Be Rock [1977] [Album]\nThis torrent has this release: 1989 - Albert Productions / 465256 2 / Australian CD\n\nTracklist:\n01. Go Down [05:20]\n02. Dog Eat Dog [03:35]\n03. Let There Beck [06:07]\n04. Bad Boy Boogie [04:28]\n05. Overdose [06:09]\n06. Crabsody In Blue [04:45]*\n07. Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be [04:15]\n08. Whole Lotta Rosie [05:22]\n\n* = To complicate things, Crabsody In Blue was omitted in the US and Japan. A shorter version of Problem Child became the replacement track. Problem Child was kept when the first international CD was released.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\nAC/DC - Powerage [1978] [Album]\nThis torrent has this release: 1989 - Albert Productions / 465260 2 / Australian CD\n\nTracklist:\n01. Rock 'n' Roll Damnation [03:37]\n02. Down Payment Blues [06:03]\n03. Gimme a Bullet [03:21]\n04. Riff Raff [05:11]\n05. Sin City [04:45]\n06. What's Next to the Moon [03:31]\n07. Gone Shootin' [05:05]\n08. Up to My Neck in You [04:13]\n09. Kicked in the Teeth [03:53]\n\nNote: Does not contain &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;. The European LP version is remixed on it's 1978 release. Longer and shorter fades, diffrent guitar tracks and the extra track Cold Hearted Man. This mix wasen't kept for the European CD releases, which uses the worldwide mix. \n\n\n------------------------------------------\nAC/DC - Highway to Hell [1979] [Album]\nThis torrent has this release: 1989 - Albert Productions / 465261 2 / Australian CD\n\nTracklist:\n01. Highway to Hell [03:28]\n02. Girls Got Rhythm [03:23]\n03. Walk All Over You [05:10]\n04. Touch Too Much [04:27]\n05. Beating Around the Bush [03:56]\n06. Shot Down In Flames [03:22]\n07. Get It Hot [02:34]\n08. If You Want Blood (You've Got It) [04:37]\n09. Love Hungry Man [04:17]\n10. Night Prowler [06:27]\n\nOf course, Highway to Hell is the final album AC/DC recorded with Bon Scott, the lead singer who provided the group with a fair share of its signature sleaze. Just months after its release, Scott literally partied himself to death, dying of alcohol poisoning after a night of drinking, a rock &amp; roll fatality that took no imagination to predict. In light of his passing, it's hard not to see Highway to Hell as a last testament of sorts, being that it was his last work and all, and if Scott was going to go out in a blaze of glory, this certainly was the way to do it. This is a veritable rogue's gallery of deviance, from cheerfully clumsy sex talk and drinking anthems to general outlandish behavior. It's tempting to say that Scott might have been prescient about his end ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or to see the title track as ominous in the wake of his death ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trying to spill it all out on paper, but it's more accurate to say that the ride had just gotten very fast and very wild for AC/DC, and he was simply flying high. After all, it wasn't just Scott who reached a new peak on Highway to Hell; so did the Young brothers, crafting their monster riffs into full-fledged, undeniable songs. This is their best set of songs yet, from the incessant, intoxicating boogie of &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot; to &quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It).&quot; Some of the credit should also go to Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who gives the album a precision and magnitude that the Vanda &amp; Young LPs lacked in their grimy charm. Filtered through Mutt's mixing board, AC/DC has never sounded so enormous, and they've never had such great songs, and they had never delivered an album as singularly bone-crunching or classic as this until now.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95072feef91ed51953a3979f9a22f73cbdeef96b","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+The+Bon+Scott+Era+Albums+%28australian+non-remastered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95072feef91ed51953a3979f9a22f73cbdeef96b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,7,47,238,249,30,213,25,83,163,151,159,154,34,247,60,189,238,249,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
