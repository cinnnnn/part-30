It is based on the film of the same title. The plot closely follows that of the film, although it expands on some minor events that could have been silenced or cut from the film, or shows them from a different character's point of view. For example, it follows Queen Amidala and Captain Panaka's adventure on Coruscant during Anakin Skywalker's interview in the Jedi Temple - something that is never shown or mentioned in the film since the film follows Anakin's point of view.\n\nDeveloper(s)\tBig Ape Productions\nPublisher(s)\tLucasArts\nDesigner(s)\tJohn Barnes\nMike Ebert\nDan Ross\nEric Wilder\nPlatform(s)\tWindows\nRelease date(s)\tPC\nNA April 30, 1999\nEU May, 1999\nMacintosh\nNA February 4, 2000\nPlayStation\nNA August 31, 1999\nPAL September 24, 1999\nJP December 9, 1999\nGenre(s)\tAction-adventure\nMode(s)\tSingle-player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47187f4fe202e9c693da37119c0a9e6c213e9d25","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Episode+I%3A+The+Phantom+Menace+%281999+PC+game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47187f4fe202e9c693da37119c0a9e6c213e9d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,24,127,79,226,2,233,198,147,218,55,17,156,10,158,108,33,62,157,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
