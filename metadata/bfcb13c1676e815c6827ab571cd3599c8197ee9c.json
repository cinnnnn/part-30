(not NYPD Blue) is a 30 minute crime drama that aired on ABC TV from 1967 through 1969. The show was set in the context of the New York City Police Dept. and many episodes are based on real NYPD cases. Also, many scenes from the show were filmed on location in NYC.\n\nI bought online a DVD set that includes all but 4 of the episodes from both seasons. The shows look to be from various VHS sources as the quality varies greatly but most are decent quality(for VHS anyway!)*. The filenames include a video quality rating of 1-10 and the audio is fine in all episodes.\nThere are some commercials in most episodes.\n\nI used Handbrake to convert the DVD's .VOB files to video MP4 files. I'm a novice at this stuff and Handbrake is easy to use and does a great job of compression with little quality loss. Three shows are split into 2 files and named accordingly, see list &amp; notes below.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSeason 1\n========\nTitle - Date Aired - notes\n\nShakedown 9/5/1967 \nFingerman 9/12/1967 \nThe Screaming Woman 9/19/1967 (Featuring William Divane)\nFast Gun 9/26/1967  (show in 2 parts)\nWalking Target 10/3/1967 \nMoney Man 10/10/1967 \nOld Gangsters Never Die 10/17/1967 \nTo Catch A Hero 10/31/1967 \nMurder For Infinity 11/7/1967 \nThe Pink Gumdrop 11/14/1967 \nThe Witness 11/21/1967 \nThe Boy Witness 11/28/1967 \nJoshua Fit the Battle Of Fulton Street 12/5/1967 \nThe Bomber 12/12/1967 \nWire Finish 12/19/1967\nCruise To Oblivion 12/26/1967 \nThe Patriots 1/2/1968 \nRed Headed Pigeon (file in 2 parts)\nWhich Side Are You On? 1/30/1968 (show in 2 parts)\nCry Brute 2/6/1968 \nLast Port of Call 2/13/1968 \nMacho 2/20/1968  (1st 67 sec. no video)\nStones 2/27/1968 \nThe Private Eye Puzzle 3/5/1968 \nNothing Is Real But the Dead(SE01EP25) (pt1) 3/12/1968  (also incl. 1st half of pt2, SE01EP26)\nNothing Is Real But the Dead(SE01EP26) (pt2) 3/19/1968 (last half of show, pt2)\n\nSeason 2\n========\nNaked in the Streets 10/1/1968\nEncounter on a Rooftop 10/8/1968 \nDay Tripper 10/15/1968 \nWhat's A Nice Girl 10/29/1968 \nDeadly Circle of Violence 11/12/1968 (Featuring Al Pacino &amp; Jill Clayburgh)\nCase of the Shady Lady 11/19/1968  (Featuring Harvey Keitel)\nThe Golden Fleece 11/26/1968 \nThe Peep Freak (SE02EP08 Episode MISSING)\nWalk the Long Pier 12/10/1968\nThe Witch of 116th Street (SE02EP10 Episode MISSING)\nL Is For Love &amp; Larceny 12/24/1968 (no end credits, incl part of &quot;Last Port of Call&quot;)\nThe Love Hustle 12/31/1968 \nThe Body in the Trunk 1/7/1969\nThe Night Watch 1/21/1969 \nThree-Fifty-Two 1/28/1969\nThe Attacker 2/4/1969 \nCandy Man (pt1) 2/11/1969  (Featuring James Earl Jones)\nCandy Man (pt2) 2/18/1969  (Featuring James Earl Jones)\nWho's Got the Bundle? 2/25/1969  (Featuring Roy Schieder, show starts at 4m09s)\nFace of the Dart Board 3/4/1969 \nBoys Night Out (SE02EP21 Episode MISSING)\nEverybody Loved Him (SE02EP22 Episode MISSING)\nNo Day Trippers Need Apply 3/25/1969 \n\n\n*see filename for accurate Video quality rating.\n\nFor more N.Y.P.D. info see: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.Y.P.D._%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.Y.P.D._%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061282/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061282/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfcb13c1676e815c6827ab571cd3599c8197ee9c","amp;dn":"N.Y.P.D.++TV+Series+%281967-69%29+Season+1-2+%28SE01EP04+-+SE02EP23%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfcb13c1676e815c6827ab571cd3599c8197ee9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,203,19,193,103,110,129,92,104,39,171,87,28,211,89,156,129,151,238,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
