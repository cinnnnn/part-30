Her husband wanted them to commit suicide in the French countryside, but she refused. \n\nAmbrose and Turner explore these and other intriguing facts about the most famous (but departed) women in literary history.\n\n\n\nAbout the Authors:\n=================\n\nElaine Ambrose is the author of Menopause Sucks and an author of five other books. Her short stories and feature articles appear in several anthologies and magazines.\n\nAK Turner is the creator of The Writers' Block on Radio Boise. She writes a humor column for the Boise City Revue and served as a Writer-in-Residence. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15699001-drinking-with-dead-women-writers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15699001-drinking-with-dead-women-writers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2354b5b93e250e3fc2c8a778b3882e754fdd5f","amp;dn":"Drinking+with+Dead+Women+Writers+-+Elaine+Ambrose%2C+AK+Turner.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2354b5b93e250e3fc2c8a778b3882e754fdd5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,35,84,181,185,62,37,14,63,194,200,167,120,179,136,46,117,79,221,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
