This chapter is \n        designed for readers who are new to Excel \n        but who have used other spreadsheet \n        products. In Chapter 2, I cover the \n        basics of formulas.\n        This chapter is absolutely essential \n        reading in order to get the most out \n        of this book. Chapter 3 deals with names. \n        If you thought names were just for cells \n        and ranges, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re \n        missing out on quite a bit.               \n   --------------------------------------------        \n     Part II: Using Functions in Your Formulas:\n     ------------------------------------------\n       This part consists of Chapters 4 \n       through 10. Chapter 4 covers the basics \n       of using worksheet functions in your \n       formulas. I get more specific in \n       subsequent chapters. Chapter 5 deals \n       with manipulating text, Chapter 6 \n       covers dates and times, and Chapter 7 \n       explores various counting techniques. \n       In Chapter 8, I discuss various types \n       of lookup formulas. Chapter 9 deals \n       with tables and worksheet databases, \n       and Chapter 10 covers a variety of \n       miscellaneous calculations such as unit \n       conversions and rounding.\n   --------------------------------------------\n     Part III: Financial Formulas:\n     -----------------------------\n        Part III consists of three chapters \n        (Chapters 11 through 13) that deal \n        with creating financial formulas.\n        YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find lots of useful formulas \n        that you can adapt to your needs.\n   --------------------------------------------   \n     Part IV: Array Formulas:\n     ------------------------\n        This part consists of Chapters 14 and \n        15. The majority of Excel users know \n        little or nothing about array formulas \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a topic that happens to be dear to me. \n        Therefore I devote an entire part to this\n        little-used yet extremely powerful \n        feature.\n   --------------------------------------------   \n     Part V: Miscellaneous Formula Techniques:\n     -----------------------------------------\n        This part consists of Chapters 16 \n        through 21. They cover a variety of \n        topics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ some of which, on the surface, \n        may appear to have nothing to do with \n        formulas. Chapter 16 demonstrates that a \n        circular reference can be a good thing. \n        In Chapter 17, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see why formulas \n        can be important when you work with \n        charts, and Chapter 18 covers formulas \n        as they relate to pivot tables. Chapter \n        19 contains some very interesting \n        (and useful) formulas that you can use \n        in conjunction with ExcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conditional \n        formatting and data validation features. \n        Chapter 20 covers a topic that I call \n        ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmegaformulas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A megaformula is a huge \n        formula that takes the place of several \n        intermediary formulas. And what do you \n        do when your formulas donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work \n        correctly? Consult Chapter 21 for some \n        debugging techniques.\n   --------------------------------------------   \n     Part VI: Developing Custom Worksheet \n              Functions:\n     ------------------------------------\n        This part consists of Chapters 22 \n        through 25. This is the part that \n        explores Visual Basic for Applications \n        (VBA), the key to creating custom \n        worksheet functions. Chapter 22 \n        introduces VBA and the VB Editor, and \n        Chapter 23 provides some necessary \n        background on custom worksheet functions. \n        Chapter 24 covers programming concepts, \n        and Chapter 25 provides a slew of worksheet\n        function examples that you can use as-is,\n        or customize for your own needs.\n   --------------------------------------------             \n     Part VII: Appendixes:\n     ---------------------\n        WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a computer book without \n        appendixes? This book has four appendixes. \n        In the appendixes, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find a quick \n        reference guide to ExcelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worksheet \n        functions, tips on using custom number \n        formats, and a handy guide to Excel \n        resources on the Internet. The final \n        appendix describes all the files on the CD-ROM.\n   --------------------------------------------\t\n      \n        P.S:\n        ----\n        \n        Secure Torrent Downloas:\n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://ÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¡.ws/Excel-2010-Formula&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ÃƒÂ¢Ã…Â¾Ã‚Â¡.ws/Excel-2010-Formula&lt;/a&gt;\n==================================================        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709e2ede46c84e84c8248d3a4e49399d07faa63b","amp;dn":"Excel+2010+Formulas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709e2ede46c84e84c8248d3a4e49399d07faa63b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,158,46,222,70,200,78,132,200,36,141,58,78,73,57,157,7,250,166,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
