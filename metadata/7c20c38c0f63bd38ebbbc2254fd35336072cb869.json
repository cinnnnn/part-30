I want others to read them and recommend other books I may also enjoy (amazon can only do so much)\n\nI'm especially interested in adding some economic literature to this list.\n\nThanks!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c20c38c0f63bd38ebbbc2254fd35336072cb869","amp;dn":"nonfiction+for+the+contemporary+intellectual+non+fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c20c38c0f63bd38ebbbc2254fd35336072cb869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,32,195,140,15,99,189,56,235,187,194,37,79,211,83,54,7,44,184,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
