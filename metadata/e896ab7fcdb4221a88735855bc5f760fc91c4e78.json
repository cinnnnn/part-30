The album title was named after a mental institution built in Leeds, England in the 1800's. For this album the band recruited American hip hop and electronica producer Dan The Automator, who is best known for his work on the first Gorillaz's album. Two years in the making, the new album is the sound of a band at the peak of their powers. A fifty-two minute mash up of sky-scraping melodies, electro-punk riffs, Morricone-esque symphonics, Mariachi stomps and psych-pop lullabies, it is both a stadium sized declaration of intent and a bar-raising benchmark for rock music in 2009.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e896ab7fcdb4221a88735855bc5f760fc91c4e78","amp;dn":"Kasabian+-+West+Rider+Pauper+Lunatic+Asylum+%5Bmp3-160-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e896ab7fcdb4221a88735855bc5f760fc91c4e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,150,171,127,205,180,34,26,136,115,88,85,188,95,118,15,201,28,78,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
