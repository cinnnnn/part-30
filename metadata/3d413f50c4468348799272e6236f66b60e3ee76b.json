Led by David LaFlamme (flute/violin/vocals) and his wife, Linda LaFlamme (keyboards), the six-piece unit on this album vacillates between light and ethereal pieces such as the lead-off cut, &quot;White Bird,&quot; to the heavier, prog rock-influenced &quot;Bombay Calling.&quot; One of the most distinct characteristics of It's a Beautiful Day is their instrumentation. The prominence of David LaFlamme -- former violin soloist with the Utah Symphony and original member of Dan Hicks &amp; His Hot Licks -- adds a refinement to It's a Beautiful Day's sound. Likewise, the intricate melodies -- mostly composed by the LaFlammes -- are structured around the band's immense virtuosity, a prime example being the exquisitely haunting harpsichord-driven &quot;Girl With No Eyes.&quot; The noir framework, as well as lyrics such as &quot;...she's just a reflection of all of the time I've been high,&quot; point rather candidly to the hallucinogenic nature of the song's -- if not the band's -- influences. The same can be said of the languidly eerie &quot;Bulgaria.&quot; The almost chant-like quality of the track slowly crescendos into an hypnotic and dreamlike sonic journey -- led by LaFlamme's brilliant violin work. By virtue of being a Bay Area fixture in the late '60s, It's a Beautiful Day could also easily double as a hippie dance band -- which they can also execute with great aplomb -- as the wildly up-tempo &quot;Time Is&quot; amply proves. It's a Beautiful Day remains as a timepiece and evidence of how sophisticated rock &amp; roll had become in the fertile environs of the San Francisco music scene. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d413f50c4468348799272e6236f66b60e3ee76b","amp;dn":"1969+-+It%27s+A+Beautiful+Day-+It%27s+A+Beautiful+Day+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d413f50c4468348799272e6236f66b60e3ee76b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,65,63,80,196,70,131,72,121,146,114,230,35,111,102,182,14,62,231,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
