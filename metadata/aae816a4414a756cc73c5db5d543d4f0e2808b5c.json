Covering their meteoric rise to fame from their debut album Fallen, and their continued success thereafter, this documentary film gives a revealing insight into Evanescence to a depth previously uncharted. Featuring interviews with Amy Lee, and with her father, band members past and present, and those closest to them, as well as rare archive film, footage previously unseen, exclusive photographs, and much more besides, this really is the definitive DVD about this most talented and challenging of groups. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aae816a4414a756cc73c5db5d543d4f0e2808b5c","amp;dn":"%5B2012%5D+Evanescence+-+From+A+Little+Rock+To+A+Great+Big+Sound+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aae816a4414a756cc73c5db5d543d4f0e2808b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,232,22,164,65,74,117,108,199,60,93,181,213,67,212,240,226,128,139,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
