Long\n\nPenciled and Inked by Andy Kuhn\n\nColors by Bill Crabtree\n\nThis harrowing new miniseries follows Duncan, a desperate man at a drug rehabilitation center who becomes the reluctant participant in a harebrained scheme involving himself, three of his roommates from rehab, and a drug-sniffing dog. The dog sniffs out drug-filled storage units that the team can then rip off. Everything goes as planned until a deranged drug trafficker finds his storage unit empty and goes looking for his merchandise... and the men who took it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3908e08b5087c90357d9e1e948dc24ba35623713","amp;dn":"Easy+Way","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3908e08b5087c90357d9e1e948dc24ba35623713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,8,224,139,80,135,201,3,87,217,225,233,72,220,36,186,53,98,55,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
