It was the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut single and later appeared on their full-length album Accelerator it reached #22 on the UK singles chart. The track has been remixed and released many times since its original release, both legitimately and in bootleg format on CD, Vinyl and Cassette.\n\nThe song became a popular rave and club track almost immediately upon its release. The original mix notably samples the bassline from Meat Beat ManifestoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proto-jungle track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRadio BabylonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, vocal samples of Lisa GerrardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singing lifted from the Dead Can Dance song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDawn Of The IconoclastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from their 1987 album Within the Realm of a Dying Sun and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShelter MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Circuit. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPapua New GuineaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was perhaps FSOLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most club-oriented track; most of the remixes on the single are very dancefloor-friendly. After AcceleratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release, however, they moved in increasingly ambient and experimental directions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfc561f3e7798600400a1e38626a145084b9e2b","amp;dn":"FSOL+-+Papua+New+Guinea+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfc561f3e7798600400a1e38626a145084b9e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,252,86,31,62,119,152,96,4,0,161,227,134,38,161,69,8,75,158,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
