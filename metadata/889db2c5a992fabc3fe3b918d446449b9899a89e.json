For one this is because of singer extraordinaire Patrik Johansson, who has a voice that sends shivers down your spine! His voice, a mix of Tony Martin and Ronnie James Dio at their best, is the absolute revelation. Even a Jorn Lande is overshadowed here.\n\nFor the other the brilliant song writing is absolutely outstanding. Who worships the old heroes and would like to hear how classics such as &quot;Long Live Rock And Roll&quot; (RAINBOW) or &quot;Holy Diver&quot; (DIO) but also &quot;Headless Cross&quot; or &quot;Tyr&quot; (both BLACK SABBATH) would sound in today&amp;#039;s production, should definitely get this album. There is not the slightest weakness on this album. Of course the obligatory Hammond sounds shall not be left out! It is so much more surprising that Death god Peter TÃƒÂ¤gtgren signs responsible for the more than fat sound. A great old school album, which will surprise some of you, guaranteed!
