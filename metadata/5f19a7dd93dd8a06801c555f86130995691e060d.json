McGovern, Surendra M. Gupta - The Disassembly Line: Balancing and Modeling\nPublisher: McGrÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°w-Hill ProfÃƒï¿½Ã‚Âµssional | 2010-11-09 | ISBN: 007162287X | PDF | 398 pages | 1.80 MB\n\n\nThe definitive guide to the disassembly line\nThe Disassembly Line: Balancing and Modeling provides in-depth information on this complex process essential to remanufacturing, recycling, and environmentally conscious manufacturing. This pioneering work offers efficient techniques required to solve problems involving the number of workstations required and the disassembly sequencing of end-of-life products on the disassembly line.\nIn this book, the disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) is described, defined mathematically, and illustrated by case studies. Combinatorial optimization methodologies are presented as solutions to the DLBP.\nCoverage includes:\nGraphical representations of products to be disassembled\nComputational complexity of combinatorial problems\nDescription of the disassembly line and the mathematical model\nComputational complexity of the DLBP\nCombinatorial optimization searches\nExperimental instances\nAnalytical methodologies\nExhaustive search\nGenetic algorithm\nAnt colony optimization\nGreedy algorithm\nGreedy/adjacent element hill climbing hybrid\nGreedy/2-opt hybrid\nH-K heuristic\nQuantitative and qualitative comparative analysis\nThis authoritative volume also covers product planning, line and facility design, sequencing and scheduling, inventory, just in time, revenue, and unbalanced lines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f19a7dd93dd8a06801c555f86130995691e060d","amp;dn":"The+Disassembly+Line%3A+Balancing+and+Modeling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f19a7dd93dd8a06801c555f86130995691e060d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,25,167,221,147,221,138,6,128,28,85,95,134,19,9,149,105,30,6,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
