The book is a critique on the Young Hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the Bauer Brothers and their supporters. The book created a controversy with much of the press and caused Bruno Bauer to attempt to refute the book in an article which was published in WigandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Vierteljahrsschrift in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article that was published in the journal Gesellschaftsspiegel in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of The German Ideology.\n\nsummary by wikipedia.org GNU FDL,\n\nUploadet by www.opencast.de your P2P based digital ebook library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f348931d646ce0c89db665f0452d674c01dbcf12","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Holy+Family+by+Karl+Marx+%5Bwww.opencast.de%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f348931d646ce0c89db665f0452d674c01dbcf12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,72,147,29,100,108,224,200,157,182,101,240,69,45,103,76,1,219,207,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
