Getting his old job back driving an armored car, and not even convincing himself that he's making a new start, he also wants his old wife back. When he finds Anna, he quickly learns that she is involved with gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). Nonetheless, they carry on a clandestine affair, with Steve foolishly believing that Anna will return to him. Even after she marries Slim, Steve, with her encouragement, masochistically clings to this doomed obsession. So when Slim catches them together, Steve ad libs plans for an armored car robbery that includes Slim. The two rivals form an uneasy and untrusting collaboration, but Steve and Anna plan to double cross Slim. However, the title of Robert Siodmak's film noir gem is, not incidentally, Criss Cross. \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041268/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041268/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nRobert Siodmak\n\n\n\n\n\tBurt Lancaster\t... \tSteve Thompson\n\n\tYvonne De Carlo\t... \tAnna\n\tDan Duryea\t... \tSlim Dundee\n\tStephen McNally\t... \tPete Ramirez\n\tEsy Morales\t... \tOrchestra Leader\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:40\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1576 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456e7bf8a475ee4620acb56f92dc6f7145f530ba","amp;dn":"Criss+Cross+%281949%29+Burt+Lancaster+Eng+%28mulisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456e7bf8a475ee4620acb56f92dc6f7145f530ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,110,123,248,164,117,238,70,32,172,181,111,146,220,111,113,69,245,48,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
