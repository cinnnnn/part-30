Topics discussed include productive degradation of dichlorprop by transconjugant strains; weeds and their mechanisms of resistance to herbicides; application of 31P-NMR spectroscopy to glyphosate studies in plants; lethal and sublethal glyphosate effects on non-target fish species; chemical properties and genotoxic effects of phenylurea herbicides; action mode of triazines and toxic effects on vertebrates; photolysis experiments on alloxydim herbicide and biological response of its transformation product; glyphosate-resistant weeds in Southern Europe; herbicide paraquat genotoxicity-enhancement by the phenolic antioxidants Dl-A-tocopherl and 2,6-Di-Tert-Butyl-P-Cresol; glyphosate adsorption in a soil depth profile; adsorption-desorption processes and mobility of (4-Chloro-2-Methylophenoxy) acetic acid (MCPA) in Irish grassland soils; pesticides and cancer with a study on the interaction of phenoxy acid herbicides with DNA; herbicidal activity of pyrazole derivatives; behavior of herbicides in paddy water and soil after application; and laboratory lysimeter for pesticide transport studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd78f0c40ed932756a08c969accf6ec50f042a7","amp;dn":"Handbook+on+Herbicides%3A+Biological+Activity%2C+Classification","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd78f0c40ed932756a08c969accf6ec50f042a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,215,143,12,64,237,147,39,86,160,140,150,154,204,246,236,80,240,66,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
