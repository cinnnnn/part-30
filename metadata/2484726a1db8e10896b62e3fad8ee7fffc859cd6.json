Bruce Hampton, Berry Oakley Jr. and many more) making this quite one for the history books. \nA speedy recovery to Gregg from all of us at MunckMix !! \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/allman-brothers-finish-march-run-at-the-beacon-minus-gregg-but-in-high-gear-20120326&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/allman-brothers-finish-march-run-at-the-beacon-minus-gregg-but-in-high-gear-20120326&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jambands.com/news/2012/03/26/john-popper-jimmy-hall-col-bruce-and-more-sub-for-gregg-allman-at-allman-brothers-band-beacon-finale&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jambands.com/news/2012/03/26/john-popper-jimmy-hall-col-bruce-and-more-sub-for-gregg-allman-at-allman-brothers-band-beacon-finale&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2484726a1db8e10896b62e3fad8ee7fffc859cd6","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers+Band+2012-03-25+Beacon+Theatre%2C+NY+%28sbd%2C+v0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2484726a1db8e10896b62e3fad8ee7fffc859cd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,132,114,106,29,184,225,8,150,182,46,63,173,142,231,255,252,133,156,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
