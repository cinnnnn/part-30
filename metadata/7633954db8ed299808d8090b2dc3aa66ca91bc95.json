The formed a band, Joy Division. Three years later it was a matter of art, life and death.\n\nNow, thirty years later, they are enjoying a larger audience and more influence than ever before, with a profound legacy that resonates fiercely in today's heavily careerist music industry and over-mediated pop culture.\n\nFeaturing the unprecedented participation of the surviving band members (now known as New Order), the film examines the band's story as depicted through never-before-seen live performance footage, personal photos, period films and newly discovered audiotapes. With poignant narratives from surviving members of the band - Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris - as well as accounts from Throbbing Gristle musician Genesis P.Orridge, late legendary Factory Records owner Tony Wilson, iconic Factory Records graphic artist Peter Saville, photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn, Belgian journalist Annik Honore and others, the film is a fresh visual account of a time and place.\n\nFrom director Grant Gee and producers Tom Atencio, Tom Astor and Jacqui Edenbrow. Joy Division chronicles a time of great social and political change in England and tells the untold story of four men who transcended economic and cultural barriers to produce an enduring musical legacy.\n\n\nMain Movie and Extras Details:\n\nFormat: Avi\nMain Movie soundtrack: AC3\nAspect Ratio: Widescreen \nExtras Soundtrack: MP3\nSize: 1.7GB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7633954db8ed299808d8090b2dc3aa66ca91bc95","amp;dn":"Joy+Division+-+Their+Own+Story+In+Their+Own+Words+-+Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7633954db8ed299808d8090b2dc3aa66ca91bc95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,51,149,77,184,237,41,152,8,216,9,11,45,195,170,102,202,145,188,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
