The duo's mission is to remove from the premises a team of oil exploration, as the project was interrupted. Shortly after takeoff the flight back, when flying over the Gobi desert, the plane faces strong sandstorm, which kicks off its antennae and destroys the left engine. The plane suffered a general breakdown and Frank is forced to make a forced landing in the desert. With no chance of malfunctioning and repair aircraft, the 11 crew members find themselves stuck in the desert and, to make matters worse, with little food and water. Until one of the survivors, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi), proposes a crazy idea: build a new plane with the wreckage of the first. The proposal is rejected by all but immediately, with the situation becoming increasingly critical, they decide to take the risk and plan ahead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a35a7777376e32273a4b49f90db4b1243358e8","amp;dn":"Flight+of+the+Phoenix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a35a7777376e32273a4b49f90db4b1243358e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,163,90,119,119,55,110,50,39,58,75,73,249,13,180,177,36,51,88,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
