Why, itch relief, of course! If volume 1 of our series (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teach Me to MonkeyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) left you with an acute case of R&amp;B pruritus, we at Vampisoul are here to dispense 20 more doses of musical medicine to help you SCRATCH THAT ITCH!\n\nWe clawed our way into the King Records vaults again to come up with more virtuosic instrumentals (Ã¢â‚¬ËœMarsanovaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rhymes with Ã¢â‚¬Å“bossa novaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, more or less, if you pronounce organist supreme Hank MarrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surname with the right accent; Freddy King raises Mr Marr two dance crazes in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBossa Nova Watusi TwistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢); more classy love songs with a hook (Ã¢â‚¬ËœBurnt Toast And Black CoffeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, besides being the epitome of that particular sub-subgenre, is highly elusive and expensive on an original Federal 45 and much in demand in the R&amp;B dance parlors of Western Europe; kudos to the gong banger on the plaintive Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou Have My BlessingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢); more unholy dances (Ã¢â‚¬ËœMonkey TonightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is one of Eddie KirkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more restrained performances, believe it or not; this compilationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track describes a dance that, like so many of the worthwhile ones, might get you escorted from your high-school prom in handcuffs if you tried it); and more holy nonsense (Ã¢â‚¬Å“My name is Puddentane,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ declares the prolific and wonderful Lula Reed, an earthily appropriate reply to Hank BallardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to-the-point pick-up line Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your NameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; if Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhiz-A-Shoo-Pepi-DadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ meant anything, would it get your hips shaking quite so violently?). Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the record thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost always in my DJ box, one of my favorite 45s ever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so exciting when its drums and taunting female chorus kick in over a loud system in a sweaty club, only to be answered by Johnny WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blistering voice and guitar: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I say, I love you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The women singing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get them women off your mindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ confusingly, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get them off my mind.\n\nAnd the capper? A strong contender for Greatest Song Ever, in its best incarnation: Otis ReddingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœShout BamalamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The custodians of the King vaults couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come up with this recording for us; for some reason, they found only a tamer mix. I had to dub it off my well-worn 45 (speaking of scratches!).\n\nMr Fine Wine\nWFMUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Downtown SoulvilleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show\n\n1. Marsanova (Hank Marr\n2. Buggy Ride (Rudy Ray Moore)\n3.
