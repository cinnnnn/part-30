The mathematical theory is mature, and continues to give rise to problems of special beauty and difficulty. Percolation is pivotal for studying more complex physical systems exhibiting phase transitions. The emphasis of this book is upon core mathematical material and the presentation of the shortest and most accessible proofs. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical physics. Almost no specialist knowledge is assumed. Much new material appears in this second edition, including: dynamic and static renormalization, strict inequalities between critical points, a sketch of the lace expansion, and several essays on related fields and applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4bbbe01cf28ef420cf104e345bfe6e1e93c0727","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B2009%5D+Percolation+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4bbbe01cf28ef420cf104e345bfe6e1e93c0727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,187,190,1,207,40,239,66,12,241,4,227,69,191,230,225,233,60,7,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
