By any title, the film was arguably the most successful Scandinavian film of the silent era, playing to turn-away business throughout Europe. Based on a play by Sven Rindon, the film centers upon Johannes Meyer, an insensitive bully who browbeats his wife and children beyond all reason. The big jerk is taught a lesson by his own nanny, now an aging crone, who begins giving him a dose of his own medicine. This humiliating experience enables Meyer to stage a warm reunion with his wife, who had previously walked out on him. It may seem like basic sitcom material, but Master of the House apparently struck a nerve in the chauvinistically inclined Europe and Denmark of 1925. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebcacb034d8b044471e0a7aa8613952e908b8081","amp;dn":"Du+Skal+Are+Din+Hustru%2C+Carl+Th.+Dreyer%2C+1925","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebcacb034d8b044471e0a7aa8613952e908b8081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,202,203,3,77,139,4,68,113,224,167,170,134,19,149,46,144,139,128,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
