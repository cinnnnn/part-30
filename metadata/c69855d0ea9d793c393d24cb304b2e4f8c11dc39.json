The music is however so tremendously good, that I really had to share this. It was not found on Pirate Bay yet!\n\nTogether with this torrent comes a few pictures that was found in the songbook and the labels; anything else needed, just mention it.\n\nEnjoy and help me seeding this beautiful music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69855d0ea9d793c393d24cb304b2e4f8c11dc39","amp;dn":"Scott+Joplin%5C%27s+Treemonisha+-+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69855d0ea9d793c393d24cb304b2e4f8c11dc39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,152,85,208,234,157,121,60,57,61,36,203,48,75,46,79,140,17,220,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
