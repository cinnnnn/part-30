An experienced team of researchers continually canvas courts across the country in search of the most compelling, unique and thought-provoking cases. Running the gamut from disputes between neighbors and family members, to dissatisfied customers suing businesses, Milians decisions based on current law are final and binding. These cases are never about the money, theyre about principle, Milian proclaims. The Peoples Court has been delivering reality television to viewers for over two decades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be879b316948b40e04ea4b3fd4df10fcd4fe80ec","amp;dn":"The+Peoples+Court+S16E76+-S16E87","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be879b316948b40e04ea4b3fd4df10fcd4fe80ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,135,155,49,105,72,180,14,4,234,75,63,212,223,16,252,212,254,128,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
