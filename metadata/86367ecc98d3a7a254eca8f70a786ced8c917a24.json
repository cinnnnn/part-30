A new and refreshed edition of the popular board game, designed to fit the style of the City of Secrets.\n\nThe City of Secrets has more secrets and hidden places than anyone could have imagined. Deep inside the bowels of the Earth, in an abandoned mine, there is a very old and, one has to admit, pretty well-designed gate. \n\nBehind it lies... well, that's the heart of the problem actually - nobody knows what the aforementioned gate guards, because a security-crazed ancient builder decided to secure it with a multi-leveled puzzle. Face the ancient challenge and see what tasks await you in the City of Secrets 2!\n\nThis product was not tested on animals. During the production process, no sweet potatoes were injured, nor any other funny vegetable... neither a fruit... OK, we admit: someone was hurt - one coder had a runny nose, a very irritating one.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nMinor bugs fixed.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.aidemmedia.Skyline&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.aidemmedia.Skyline&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86367ecc98d3a7a254eca8f70a786ced8c917a24","amp;dn":"Reiner+Knizia%27s+Skyline+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86367ecc98d3a7a254eca8f70a786ced8c917a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,54,126,204,152,211,167,162,84,236,168,247,10,120,108,237,140,145,122,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
