How can you put the awesome power of Six Sigma to work for your organization?\n\nThe Six Sigma Revolution shows managers and implementers how to create and sustain a Six Sigma initiative in any organization. This hands-on resource explains how and why Six Sigma is superior to other quality improvement methods. Unlike other books on this topic, it lays out the strategic component of Six Sigma and demonstrates how to create the infrastructure for its successful implementation in any company of any size.\n\nSimple but detailed Six Sigma tactics drive improved effectiveness, efficiency, and profits. This easy-to-use, step-by-step guide describes these powerful tactics and shows managers how to:\n* Create charter teams to work on processes that directly impact strategic objectives\n* Calculate sigma at the process level\n* Create specific, measurable problem statements for project teams to solve\n* Use analysis and improvement tools to optimize sigma performance\n* Transfer an improved process and sustain it over time\n\nRecognizing the need to manage cultural change connected with the initiative, this book helps you make the transition to managing with facts and data; diagnose and overcome four major types of resistance; and create a business quality management counsel to ensure the success of the initiative. Finally, you'll discover the ten ways in which Six Sigma initiatives can fail and how to avoid or overcome them to become another Six Sigma success story.\n\nFilled with real-world case studies that illustrate the right and wrong ways to implement Six Sigma, as well as dozens of helpful charts and tables that help you track your progress, this practical guide makes for fast, easy reading that will help you transform your organization from an also-ran to the leader of the pack. \n\nAbout author:\nGeorge Eckes (Superior, CO) is the founder and principal consultant for Eckes &amp; Associates.
