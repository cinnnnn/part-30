There are very few books in which you can open up any page and immediately find a quotable and inspiring passage that will make you think hard, laugh out loud, or see things a completely new way. This is certainly one of them. He covers every topic related to economics and politics, from the business cycle, to trade, to the drug war, to environmentalism. His central thesis is that the threat to liberty comes from both the Left and the Right, and that neither really offers a consistent way out. The real problem is much deeper than either the Right or the Left recognizes. It is the institution of the state itself, which everyone seems to want to use to his own philosophical advantage. The problem, he writes, is not that we have chosen the wrong flavor of public policy but that we have public policy at all. All forms of policyÃ¢â‚¬â€decisions made by state institutions that affect the uses of private property according to political prioritiesÃ¢â‚¬â€amount to invasions of liberty. Relentlessly moving from left-wing to right-wing and back to left-wing policy is not progress; it means continued movement down the road to serfdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a7f1e5972ae5c18ca6595a4b6ea9e891010a992","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+The+Left%2C+The+Right%2C+%26amp%3B+The+State.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a7f1e5972ae5c18ca6595a4b6ea9e891010a992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,127,30,89,114,174,92,24,202,101,149,164,182,234,158,137,16,16,169,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
