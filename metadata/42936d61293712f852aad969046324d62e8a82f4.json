It is in PDF because my image to text converter isn&amp;#039;t working.  But hey, at least no spelling mistakes.\n\n\nFrom the back cover:\n\nIn this timely call to arms, Naomi Wolf compels us to face the way our free America is under assault.  She warns us - with the straight-to-fellow-citizens urgency of one of Thomas Paine&amp;#039;s revolutionary pamphlets - that we have little time to lose if we are to live in real freedom.\nWolf shows that there are ten classic steps dictators or would-be dictators always take when they wish to close down an open society.  Each of those ten steps is now underway in the United States today.\nThe End of America will shock, enrage, and motivate - spurring us to act, as the Founders would have counted on us to do in a time such as this, as rebels and patriots - to save our liberty and defend our nation.\n\n\nContents: \n\nPreface\nIntroduction: Ten Steps\n1.
