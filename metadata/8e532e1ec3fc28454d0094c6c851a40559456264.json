Mordru tells the collected heroes that he tried to grab three ancient, mystic artifacts instead of the heroes. He tried to force the Legion of Super-Heroes to gather the artifacts, but they fought him off instead. Now he's forcing the members of the Justice League and the Justice Society to get the artifacts by holding two of their members hostage.
