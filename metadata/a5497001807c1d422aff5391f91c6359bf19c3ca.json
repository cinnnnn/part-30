Soon, though, Richard is consumed by his executive role at a large New York university, and Liz, who has traded in her academic career to oversee the lives of their children, is hectically ferrying young Coco around town.\n\nFifteen-year-old Jake is gratefully taken into the fold by a group of friends at Wildwood, an elite private school.\n\nBut the upper-class cocoon in which they have enveloped themselves is ripped apart when Jake wakes up one morning after an unchaperoned party and finds an email in his in-box from an eighth-grade admirer. Attached is a sexually explicit video she has made for him. Shocked, stunned, maybe a little proud, and scaredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a jumble of adolescent emotionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he forwards the video to a friend, who then for-wards it to a friend. Within hours, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gone viral, all over the school, the city, the world.\n\nThe ensuing scandal threatens to shatter the BergamotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sense of security and identity, and, ultimately, their happiness. They are a good family faced with bad choices, and how they choose to react, individually and at one anotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behest, places everything they hold dear in jeopardy.\n\nThis Beautiful Life is a devastating exploration of the blurring boundaries of privacy and the fragility of self, a clear-eyed portrait of modern life that will have readers debating their assumptions about family, morality, and the sacrifices and choices we make in the name of love. \n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5497001807c1d422aff5391f91c6359bf19c3ca","amp;dn":"This+Beautiful+Life+-+Helen+Schulman%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5497001807c1d422aff5391f91c6359bf19c3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,73,112,1,128,124,29,66,42,255,83,145,249,28,99,89,191,25,195,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
