A polymath\nmonarch, she was also a potent combination of traditionalist\nand innovator, astute enough to realize what was necessary\nfor EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continued prosperity and sufficiently ruthless\nto allow nothing to stand in her way. Yet our understanding\nof Cleopatra has been obscured by Roman propaganda,\nShakespearean tragedy, and Hollywood glamour. Cleopatra the\nGreat pieces together the pharaohÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancient world with details\nabout her massive library and infamous banquets, her\nrelationships with both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and her\nskillful use of fashion and style to further her ambitions and\nher mystique. Intelligent and compulsively readable, here is\nan unparalleled biography worthy of its subject.\n\nCleopatra the Great:\nThe Woman Behind the Legend\nBy: Joann Fletcher\nISBN13: 9780062106056\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 1058","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:745d4e85c6915145806f34593422a0ec04b63a0b","amp;dn":"Cleopatra+the+Great+The+Woman+Behind+the+Legend+by+Joann+Fletche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"745d4e85c6915145806f34593422a0ec04b63a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,93,78,133,198,145,81,69,128,111,52,89,52,34,160,236,4,182,58,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
