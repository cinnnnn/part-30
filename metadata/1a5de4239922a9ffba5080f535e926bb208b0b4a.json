Edie Falco stars as the title character Jackie O'Hurley, a strong-willed and brilliant -- but very flawed -- emergency room nurse in a complicated New York City hospital. A lapsed Catholic with an occasional weakness for Vicodin and Adderall to get her through the days, Jackie keeps the hospital balanced with her own kind of justice. Every day is a high wire act of juggling patients, doctors, fellow nurses and her own indiscretions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5de4239922a9ffba5080f535e926bb208b0b4a","amp;dn":"Nurse.Jackie.S05E08.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5de4239922a9ffba5080f535e926bb208b0b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,93,228,35,153,34,169,255,186,80,128,245,53,233,38,187,32,139,11,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
