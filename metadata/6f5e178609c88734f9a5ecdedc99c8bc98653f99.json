Other than &quot;Our Love&quot; (a familiar classical theme adapted to American pop music by Larry Clinton), all six selections are originals by the pianist. \n\nUtilizing a nonet that includes trumpeter Johnny Coles (who does his best to be soulful on &quot;Honeybuns&quot;), trombonist Garnett Brown, flutist Les Spann, altoist James Spaulding, tenor saxophonist George Coleman, baritonist Pepper Adams, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Mickey Roker, Pearson performs music in a style that would have fit in quite well on Blue Note.\n\nMost memorable among his originals is &quot;Is That So.&quot; This is not an essential date, but it is nice to have this rarity back in print again. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
