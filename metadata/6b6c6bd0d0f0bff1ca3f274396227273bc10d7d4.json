The Cheesemonger's Kitchen collects 90 delightful recipes that move cheese into a meal's starring role. Culled from chef and cheesemonger Chester Hastings's 25 years of experience, these recipes take full advantage of the varied flavors of cheese in ways both traditional and innovative. A cheese book that focuses on recipes rather than acting as a buyers guide or primer, this substantive and personal exploration accompanied by 50 color photographs plus wine pairing tips from acclaimed sommelier Brian Kalliel is a comprehensive guide to the vast world of specialty cheeses.\n\nAbout the Author\nChester Hastings is a chef, cheesemonger, and writer. He lives in Los Angeles where he works at the celebrated gourmet emporium Joan's on Third.
