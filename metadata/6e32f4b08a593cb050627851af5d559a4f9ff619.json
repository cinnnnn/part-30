Some of the useful applications of four-dimensional spinors, such as YangÃ¢â‚¬â€œMills theory, are derived in detail using illustrative examples.Spinors in Four-Dimensional Spaces is aimed at graduate students and researchers inmathematical and theoretical physics interested in the applications of the two-component spinor formalism in any four-dimensional vector space or Riemannian manifold with a definite or indefinite metric tensor. This systematic and self-contained book is suitable as a seminar text, a reference book, and a self-study guide.\n\n\n# Perfect Paperback: 188 pages\n# Publisher: Springer (2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0817649859\n# ISBN-13: 978-0817649852","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e32f4b08a593cb050627851af5d559a4f9ff619","amp;dn":"Spinors+in+Four-Dimensional+Spaces+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e32f4b08a593cb050627851af5d559a4f9ff619","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,50,244,176,138,89,60,176,80,98,120,81,175,93,85,154,79,159,246,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
