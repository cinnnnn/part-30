Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce walk into a Parisian bar... no, it's not the beginning of a joke, but the premise of Jason's unique new graphic novel. Set in 1920s Paris, The Left Bank Gang is a deliciously inventive re-imagining of these four literary figures as not only typical Jason anthropomorphics, but...graphic novelists! Yes, in Jason's warped world, cartooning is the dominant form of fiction, and not only do these four work literary giants work in the comics medium but they get together to discuss pen vs. brush, chat about the latest graphic novels from Dostoevsky (&quot;I can't tell any of his characters apart!&quot;) to Faulkner (&quot;Hasn't he heard of white space? His panels are too crowded!&quot;), and bemoan their erratic careers. With guest appearances by Zelda Fitzgerald and Jean-Paul Sartre, and a few remarkable twists and turns along the way, and you've got one of the funniest and most playful graphic novels of the year. Like Jason's acclaimed Why Are You Doing This?, The Left Bank Gang is rendered in full spectacular color. - See more at: http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-left-bank-gang-with-free-signed-bookplate.html#sthash.Hx2I91nA.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17698d345c0bccc08d4a8d707cbaa18e3d6e10bd","amp;dn":"Jason%3A+The+Left+Bank+Gang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17698d345c0bccc08d4a8d707cbaa18e3d6e10bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,105,141,52,92,11,204,192,141,74,141,112,124,186,161,142,61,110,16,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
