The bloodshed opens in 1942 with a scene of a little boy axing his mother after her discovery of him piecing together a puzzle of a nude girl. Cut to 42 years later and the little ax-man has moved on to chainsaws as he begins buzzing coeds on the campus of a New England college. Police Lieutenant Bracken (Christopher George) and his partner arrive to investigate. They find a trail of dismembered bodies that happen to be missing some parts and a group of suspects including a shady dean of students (Edmund Purdom), an anatomy professor (Jack Taylor), and a monstrous caretaker (Paul Smith). Led by beautiful undercover cop Mary Riggs (Lynda Day-George) and student-stud Kendall (Ian Sera), the investigation leads everyone to the killer, who has just finished adding the final pieces to his human jigsaw puzzle\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/f7e2ac8b2fa6db41fcac2df2ecd10c5e6981a77d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/f7e2ac8b2fa6db41fcac2df2ecd10c5e6981a77d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nimdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082748/\n\n\nTrailers:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a0b5fe6c2d3777dc0f000953fbe5e9dbd72bd1","amp;dn":"Pieces+1982-zombiRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a0b5fe6c2d3777dc0f000953fbe5e9dbd72bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,160,181,254,108,45,55,119,220,15,0,9,83,251,229,233,219,215,43,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
