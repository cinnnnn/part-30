Pau-Pau Island (Ã£â€šÂ¯Ã£Æ’Â­Ã£Æ’Æ’Ã£â€šÂ¯!Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£â€šÂ¦Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£â€šÂ¦Ã£â€šÂ¢Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’â€°?)) is a platform video game published by Fox Interactive and developed by Argonaut Software for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color. It follows main protagonist Croc, and his attempts to rescue the furry creatures known as Gobbos from the main antagonist, Baron Dante.\n\nPLOT:\nPlot[edit source | editbeta]\n\nThe Gobbo King Rufus is watching the sunset when he notices a small basket in the lake, containing a small, screaming baby crocodile. The Gobbos raise him and train him to become one of their own. Croc eventually grows to twice the size of a normal Gobbo.\nAll is peaceful, until one day, one of the Gobbos shouts out a warning... &quot; Dantinis!&quot;. Suddenly, the evil Baron Dante arrives and invades Gobbo Island with the help of his demon rascals, the Dantinis. He imprisons many of the Gobbos, most notably their King, whom he keeps in a steel cage within his castle island. Before the Gobbo King is taken, he strikes a magical gong that summons a yellow bird called Beany. Beany shrinks Croc before whisking him away to safety. Croc then goes on a quest to free all the Gobbos and defeat the evil Baron Dante himself.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGameplay[edit source | editbeta]\n\nCroc is a free-roaming game title, with Croc's movement differing slightly depending on whether players use the directional pad or the analog controller to control him. His main moves consist of a tail whip attack that can temporarily destroy enemies, and a hit drop used for smashing open crates (the same move in the Super Mario series). Croc also possess the ability to swim in select levels. Throughout the game Croc collects crystals which serve as health in a similar fashion to golden rings in Sonic the Hedgehog, meaning the player will lose a life if hit without holding any crystals in their inventory. Crystals retained at the end of a level are stored, with Croc gaining an extra life for every 100 he collects.\nProgressing through the levels involves finding and hitting the Beany Gong at the end of the level to move onto the next, facing two bosses during each island. However, to fully complete the game, Croc has to rescue the captured Gobbos throughout each level. Each level contains six Gobbos, including one hidden behind a door at the end of the level. This Gobbo can only be released by collecting five coloured crystals throughout the level. Collecting all the Gobbos before a boss level unlocks an extra level in which a Jigsaw Piece can be earned. When the player collects all of these pieces, a new island is opened up, leading to the game's final boss, Baron Dante in crystal form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c210248492b39549f9bcc7299535ac11b6a9d624","amp;dn":"Croc+USA+PSX2PSP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c210248492b39549f9bcc7299535ac11b6a9d624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,16,36,132,146,179,149,73,249,188,199,41,149,53,172,17,182,169,214,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
