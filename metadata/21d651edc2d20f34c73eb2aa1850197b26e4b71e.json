Setlist was great\n\n, a few i hadn\\&amp;#039;t heard live before and sheep baby sheep,\n\ni love the animals album,i think he should go out and \n\nplay that whole album live. seeing darkside in its entirity\n\nwas a true rock n\\&amp;#039; roll experience and man the stage/light show\n\nwas phenomeanal,the radio controlled floating spaceman and pig\n\nand the giant prism and visuals on the back screen , ohh man!!!\n\ni\\&amp;#039;d only had a few beers taht night and almost started trippin \n\nout on the visuals for darkside,very cool\n\noverall great show,go see one this tour if ya can!!!!!\n\nrecording turned out decent,i\\&amp;#039;m quite happy with these church \n\naudio mics, easy tapin job,no hassles,people in the smoking \n\nsection on the 2000 level were smokin so much weed out there \n\nthey sent in the cops and started searchin people left and right,\n\n i don\\&amp;#039;t think anybody was charged or nuthin but they were confiscating\n\njoints alot.\n\n\n\nscooby says stay hip\n\n\n\nmike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21d651edc2d20f34c73eb2aa1850197b26e4b71e","amp;dn":"2007-06-06+-+Roger+Waters+-+Ottawa%2C+Canada+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21d651edc2d20f34c73eb2aa1850197b26e4b71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,214,81,237,194,210,15,52,199,62,178,170,24,80,25,123,38,228,183,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
