It also featured Paul Sears and Ugo Solenghi. At the beginning of the year 1982 Angelo Bergamini joined the band. Cundari had the idea of covering the song &quot;Pulstar&quot; by Vangelis for the label Memory Records. They recorded the song together with Anfrando Maiola from the group Koto. It was a real success. The record reached Gold and Platinum Disc status. It sold particularly well in Germany, where it reached number one in the charts, Latin America, Japan, even invading international charts. This first incarnation of Hipnosis continued until 1984 with further singles and an album, all of which gained had good commercial success, even if the band didn't see much of the money. In the ensuing period all of the original members left the project and Angelo turned down the proposition to stay as a composer and musician of the new line-up and decided to leave the sixty date world tour, aware that he would never get paid for his work. At the same time as Hipnosis was developing, Paul Sears officially joined Kirlian Camera's new line-up.\nIn 1987 Cundari released another 7&quot;/12&quot; (&quot;Droid&quot;) under the Hipnosis banner. Soon after he passed away. At this point the official Hipnosis-Story ends. In 1991 a CD anthology entitled &quot;Hypnosis&quot; was released. \nIn 1992 a certain Humphrey Robertson released a single and an album &quot;Lost In Space&quot; for ZYX Records under the name Hypnosis. On both releases the font-logo which can be seen on the &quot;Hypnosis&quot;-CD was used, so it seems that the label tried to re-animate Hypnosis with other musicians. The last sign of life of this replica was another 12&quot; record in 1994.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ccf72ebb8480958d2cc438f9b60a3542a83153","amp;dn":"Hypnosis+-+Hypnosis+%281991%29+%5BMP3+at+320Kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ccf72ebb8480958d2cc438f9b60a3542a83153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,204,247,46,187,132,128,149,141,44,196,56,249,182,10,53,66,168,49,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
