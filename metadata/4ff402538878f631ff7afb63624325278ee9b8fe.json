In general it is a bit more rock-guitar oriented than Mental Floss... but it still tries to combine all musical styles in one song. Unfortunately, it does not work for all songs (Duck Ska or Mr. Ezway), but they are overshadowed by gems like Routine (reason enough to buy this album), Comeback and Harvey Quinnt.\n\n\n\n01.
