Here we see how he collaborated with these and other writers: Clifford Odets, Thornton Wilder, John Steinbeck, and Budd Schulberg among them. The letters give us a unique grasp of his luminous insights on acting, directing, producing, as he writes to and about Marlon Brando, James Dean, Warren Beatty, Robert De Niro, Boris Aronson, and Sam Spiegel, among others. We see KazanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heated dealings with studio moguls Darryl Zanuck and Jack Warner, his principled resistance to film censorship, and the upheavals of his testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. \n\nThese letters record as well the inner life of the artist and the man. We see his startling candor in writing to his first wife, his confidante and adviser, Molly Day ThacherÃ¢â‚¬â€they did not mince words with each other. And we see a fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s letters to and about his children.\n\nAn extraordinary portrait of a complex, intense, monumentally talented man who engaged the political, moral, and artistic currents of the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae24bf18190bd365a4462961036a5d0acb6fdcf","amp;dn":"The+Selected+Letters+of+Elia+Kazan+-+Elia+Kazan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae24bf18190bd365a4462961036a5d0acb6fdcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,226,75,241,129,144,189,54,90,68,98,150,16,54,165,208,172,182,253,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
