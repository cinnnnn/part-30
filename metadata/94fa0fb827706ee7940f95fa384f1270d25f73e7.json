In an ever increasing effort to demystify the subject, with this edition, the authorâ€”\r\n\r\nAvoids more complex separation processes\r\nPlaces a greater emphasis on the art of simplifying assumptions\r\nConveys a greater sense of scale with the inclusion of numerous photos of actual installations\r\nMakes the math only as complicated as necessary while reviewing fundamental principles that may have been forgotten\r\n\r\nThe book explores essential principles and reinforces the concepts with classical and contemporary illustrations drawn from the engineering, environmental, and biological sciences. The theories of heat conduction and transfer are utilized not so much to draw analogies but rather to make fruitful use of existing solutions not seen in other texts on the subject.\r\n\r\nBoth an introductory resource and a reference, this important text serves environmental, biomedical, and engineering professionals, as well as anyone wishing to gain a grasp on this subject and its increasing relevance across a number of fields. It fills a void in traditional chemical engineering literature by providing access to the principles and working practices that allow mass transfer theory to be applied to separation processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94fa0fb827706ee7940f95fa384f1270d25f73e7","amp;dn":"Mass+Transfer+and+Separation+Processes+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94fa0fb827706ee7940f95fa384f1270d25f73e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,250,15,184,39,112,110,231,148,15,149,250,56,79,18,112,210,95,115,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
