Archaeology is a process of detection and supposition; this is what makes it so fascinating. However, the interpretations of archaeologists differ and change over time. They depend upon the amount of evidence available, the ideas and preconceptions of the archaeologist and their interests and aims.\nMichael Shanks's enlivening work is a guide to the discipline of classical archaeology and its objects. It assesses archaeology as a means of reconstructing ancient Greek society using the latest approaches of social archaeology. In addition, The Classical Archaeology of Greece outlines the history of the discipline and discusses why Classical Greece continues to fascinate us and why it has had such an impact on European civilization and identity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a4511dc2abd97f8d481fb900c1a8b0219d5cb8","amp;dn":"The+Classical+Archaeology+of+Greece%3A+Experiences+of+the+Discipli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5a4511dc2abd97f8d481fb900c1a8b0219d5cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,164,81,29,194,171,217,127,141,72,31,185,0,193,168,176,33,157,92,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
