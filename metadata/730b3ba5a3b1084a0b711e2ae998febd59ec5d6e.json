FileSeek is lightning fast, small and super easy to use.\r\nIt can even be integrated right into the Windows Explorer right-click menu to provide quick and easy access.\r\nFileSeek doesnâ€™t use background indexing, so when FileSeek is closed your computerâ€™s performance wonâ€™t be affected.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nLightning Fast Searching\r\n\r\nFileSeek uses multithreading technology to improve the speed of its searches, making it able to out-perform any Windows search. With no background search indexing, FileSeek will never affect the performance of your computer while closed.\r\n\t\r\nSearch Profiles\r\n\r\nImprove your workload by saving your search criteria as a Search Profile. Save, load, or modify your most common searches to make your life easier.\r\n\r\nTabbed Interface\r\n\r\nWith FileSeekâ€™s tabbed search interface, there is no longer any need to wait for a search to be complete before starting a new one. You can start a search in another tab without opening another window, keeping your taskbar neat and tidy.\r\n\t\r\nAdvanced Querying\r\n\r\nUse FileSeekâ€™s query language or regular expressions to search for specific information inside files or folders. Give up simple searching and unpredictable results, and start obtaining the information you need from your computer.\r\n\r\nSync Your Settings\r\n\r\nSync your Search Profiles between computers for easy access anywhere you are. Syncing is automatic and keeps your Search Profiles always up-to-date.\r\n\t\r\nSearch Result Actions\r\n\r\nSave search results in different formats for easy reference later, or perform common tasks such as copying, deleting, and dragging into other applications. Choose what you want FileSeek to do when you double-click on a search result by selecting from a number of pre-defined options and make your search experience entirely yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHomepage https://www.fileseek.ca/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730b3ba5a3b1084a0b711e2ae998febd59ec5d6e","amp;dn":"Binary+Fortress+Software+FileSeek+Pro+5.0.1+%28Install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730b3ba5a3b1084a0b711e2ae998febd59ec5d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,11,59,165,163,177,8,74,11,113,30,42,233,152,254,189,89,236,93,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
