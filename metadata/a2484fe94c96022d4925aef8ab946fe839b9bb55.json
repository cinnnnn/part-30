Of the 230 locomotives produced, Seaboard System Railroad (which became part of CSX Transportation in 1986) and Conrail purchased the majority between them. CSX became the last Class 1 railroad to include B36-7s in operational rosters. \r\n\r\nThe six-axle GE C36-7 predates the four-axle variant, having first been produced in 1978. Unlike the B36-7, however, the majority were exported to overseas markets. \r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Southern Big 7s for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, includes both the GE B36-7 High Nose and Low Nose variants, plus GE C36-7 ph1 AD, ph1 GSC and ph2 GSC variants in Norfolk Southern livery, and non-driver models as â€˜deadâ€™ rolling stock. Other features include class lights, step lights and number board lights, speed recorder, ditch lights and animated front and rear mirrors. \r\n\r\nThe locomotives are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Norfolk Southern Big 7s on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL WORK ON LEGIT AND PIRATED VERSION OF TRAIN SIMULATOR 2015!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2484fe94c96022d4925aef8ab946fe839b9bb55","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG%2FDTM+Norfolk+Southern+Big+7s+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2484fe94c96022d4925aef8ab946fe839b9bb55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,72,79,233,76,150,2,45,73,37,174,248,171,148,111,232,57,185,187,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
