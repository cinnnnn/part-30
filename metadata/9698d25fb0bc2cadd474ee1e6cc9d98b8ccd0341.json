Anandha Rao (Aspen, 1999).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-8342-1264-1\r\n\r\nThe book examines the concepts needed to characterize fluid andsemisolid foods and to use various ingredients to develop desirableflow properties in fluid foods and structure in gelled systems. Theauthor begins with an introduction to food rheology and applicationsin food processing. Chapters on flow properties, viscoelasticbehavior, compositional effects, and gels give the reader a fullunderstanding of the complex theories and applications related to thetexture of food","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9698d25fb0bc2cadd474ee1e6cc9d98b8ccd0341","amp;dn":"Rheology+of+Fluids+and+Semisolid+Foods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9698d25fb0bc2cadd474ee1e6cc9d98b8ccd0341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,152,210,95,176,188,44,173,212,116,238,30,108,201,217,139,140,205,3,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
