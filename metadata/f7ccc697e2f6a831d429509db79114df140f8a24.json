The album was recorded during the second leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue.\n\nThe album was partly recorded on May 23, 1976, during a concert at Hughes Stadium in Fort Collins, Colorado; the penultimate show of the tour, the concert was also filmed and later broadcast by NBC as a one-hour television special in September. (Hard Rain's release coincided with this broadcast). Four tracks from the album (&quot;I Threw It All Away,&quot; &quot;Stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,&quot; &quot;Oh, Sister,&quot; and &quot;Lay, Lady, Lay&quot;) were recorded on May 16, 1976 in Fort Worth, Texas. Neither the album nor the television special was well received.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:23\n    &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:01\n    &quot;Oh, Sister&quot; (Dylan, Jacques Levy) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:08\n    &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29\n    &quot;You're a Big Girl Now&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:01\n    &quot;I Threw It All Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n    &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ccc697e2f6a831d429509db79114df140f8a24","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Hard+Rain+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ccc697e2f6a831d429509db79114df140f8a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,204,198,151,226,246,168,49,212,41,80,157,183,145,20,223,20,15,138,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
