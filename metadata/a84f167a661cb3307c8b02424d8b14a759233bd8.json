Nearly dead, he carries nothing but the bullets in his back and the bank account number embedded in his hip. Although completely without identity or background, he possesses an array of extraordinary talents in fighting, linguistics and self-defense that speak of a dangerous past. In the present he is disoriented and wary as he is propelled into an urgent search to discover who he is and why his life has taken a perilous turn.\n\nMatt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Clive Owen\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/\n\nSpecs:\n\nVideo-\nCodec: XviD\nResolution: 720x304\nFrame Rate: 23.976\nAudio-\nCodec: mpga [mp3, VBR]\nChannels: 2\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 115 kb/s\n\nRunning Time: 1:58:17 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84f167a661cb3307c8b02424d8b14a759233bd8","amp;dn":"The+Bourne+Identity+%282002%29+DVDrip+%5BMatt+Damon%2C+Franka+Potente%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84f167a661cb3307c8b02424d8b14a759233bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,79,22,122,102,28,179,48,124,139,2,66,77,139,20,167,89,35,59,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
