Holding science and law degrees from Princeton and Columbia University, he was founder and president of Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines, which later merged with another company to become Delta Air Lines. Putnam served as chief executive of Delta, and remained a director until his death in 1998. Race and Reason was his first book which explained the reality of race in the face of a determined assault on racial realism in the 1960s. Written in question and answer format, this book answers every liberal argument on race with passion, reason, compassion and intellect. It is a testament to the fact that some people, at least, understood racial dynamics at the height of the &quot;civil rights&quot; assault on Western Civilization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c8c94b1061a412622929a9976a87c8bc25ac2d","amp;dn":"Race+and+Reason%3A+A+Yankee+View","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c8c94b1061a412622929a9976a87c8bc25ac2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,200,201,75,16,97,164,18,98,41,41,169,151,106,135,200,188,37,172,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
