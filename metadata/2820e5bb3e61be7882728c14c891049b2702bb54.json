It's a collage: schizophrenic, doubtful, and resisting to explain itself. It's an anxious, regretful mess of half-confident ideas and leftover mantras finally being able to breath; An extremely lo-fi, bedroom agenda tasked with nothing else but to become self-evident and to leave a footprint for an unknown audience. \n\nIt's hesitant and self-conscious, and unable to see itself for what the future may consist of. Presented here is nothing concrete or total of what visions Jargun is trying to conspire; they're merely suggestions. It is only a sample laid by distress, uncertainty, and desperation. \n\n\n\nBut it doesn't stop here. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2820e5bb3e61be7882728c14c891049b2702bb54","amp;dn":"Jargun+-+Jargun+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2820e5bb3e61be7882728c14c891049b2702bb54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,32,229,187,62,97,190,120,130,114,140,20,200,145,4,155,39,2,187,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
