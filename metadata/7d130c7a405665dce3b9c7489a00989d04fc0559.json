Gary and Allison are divorced but are both very likeable and still care about each other, yet much of the comedy comes from them mutually insulting each other.  Other of the comedy comes from the two of them trying to move on in relationships with other people and the difficulties that continually arise from their inability to distance themselves from each other even though they are diverced.  It works because they are likable characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d130c7a405665dce3b9c7489a00989d04fc0559","amp;dn":"Gary+Unmarried+Complete+Season+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d130c7a405665dce3b9c7489a00989d04fc0559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,19,12,122,64,86,101,220,227,185,199,72,154,0,152,157,4,252,5,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
