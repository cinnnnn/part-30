It first appeared on the 1980 album Making Movies and was released as a single in 1981. It is rumoured that the song itself has nothing to do with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but has been instead inspired by Knopfler's relationship between himself and Holly Vincent, of the band Holly and the Italians. Some of the lyrics indicate that Knopfler thought that she just used their relationship to boost her own career.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_(Dire_Straits_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_(Dire_Straits_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:03\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
