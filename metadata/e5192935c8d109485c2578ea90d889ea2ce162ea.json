So she is pissed when her father ships her off to a rural-Michigan summer camp. And when the short busses pull up, she is shocked to see that she will be counseling children with special needs.\n\nWhat puzzles Cricket more than just a world without Louis Vuitton and four-star restaurants, is how these Ã¢â‚¬Å“strange-faced&quot; kids are so comfortable with themselves. But when she connects with another counselor named Quinn, and when she becomes involved with the end-of-the-summer talent show, Cricket begins to see that she may have been the one with the problem all along","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5192935c8d109485c2578ea90d889ea2ce162ea","amp;dn":"Summer+on+the+Short+Bus+-+Bethany+Crandell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5192935c8d109485c2578ea90d889ea2ce162ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,25,41,53,200,209,9,72,92,37,120,234,144,216,137,234,44,225,98,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
