It seems that he was embarrassed\nby the orgies at which sausage was often consumed. His\npuritanical sensibilities simply wouldn&amp;#039;t stand for it. Of course he\nalso banned skinnydipping in the public baths so you know that\nhe was just no fun at all.\nOur own history might have been different if (so the story\ngoes) Captain John Smith hadn&amp;#039;t been so adept at roasting his\nhomemade Polish kielbasa over an open fire. It seems that\nPocahontas loved that sausage and so she convinced daddy to\nspare Captain John&amp;#039;s life. And they say the way to a man&amp;#039;s\nheart... ? Anyway, with a name like Smith it was no easy feat\nfor kielbasa to come to the rescue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daebf7b1b9f863f022ff8f152336906f1248661e","amp;dn":"HOME+SAUSAGE+MAKING","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daebf7b1b9f863f022ff8f152336906f1248661e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,235,247,177,185,248,99,240,34,255,143,21,35,54,144,111,18,72,102,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
