Their goal, according to Sperry, is to replace the U.S. Constitution with the Quran and turn America into an Islamic state. And, as Sperry details point-by-point, they have been unwittingly aided in their sinister aims by the politically correct media, government, and citizens, who don't fully understand the dangers of the Muslim faith.\n\nInfiltration explodes the facade of moderation and patriotism that Muslim scholars, imams, clerics, businessmen, and other leaders in the burgeoning Muslim community in America have conveyed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In reality, the Muslim establishment that publicly decries the radical fringe-represented by al-Qaida's brand of Islam known as Wahhabism, the official religion of Saudi Arabia--is actually a part of it. The only difference is that they use words and money instead of bombs to accomplish their goals.\n\nNow, thanks to Sperry's peerless research, piquant prose, and forthright presentation, their cover is blown. He will not only make readers forget nearly everything they've been told about these &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot; leaders, he will expose the true agenda of these &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot; leaders, and he will explain the full scope of the dangerous threat of Islam in America.\n\nAuthor: Paul Sperry\nPublisher: Thomas Nelson\nPublication Date: December 9, 2008\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77ada9731f913a3e07dc8097d82b7f5862ef8b6","amp;dn":"Paul+Sperry+-+Infiltration+%5BMuslim+Spies%5D+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77ada9731f913a3e07dc8097d82b7f5862ef8b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,122,218,151,49,249,19,163,224,125,200,9,125,130,183,245,134,46,248,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
