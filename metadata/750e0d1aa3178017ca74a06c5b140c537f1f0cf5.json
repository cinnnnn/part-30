This mission of mercy will lead Odd through realms of darkness he has never before encountered, as he probes the long-held secrets of a sinister estate and those who inhabit it.\n\nODD APOCALYPSE\n\nOnce presided over by a flamboyant Hollywood mogul during the Roaring Ã¢â‚¬â„¢20s, the magnificent West Coast property known as Roseland is now home to a reclusive billionaire financier and his faithful servants. And, at least for the moment, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a port in the storm for Odd Thomas and his traveling companion, the inscrutably charming Annamaria, the Lady of the Bell. In the wake of OddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent clash with lethal adversaries, the opulent manorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comforts should be welcome. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far more to Roseland than meets even the extraordinary eye of Odd, who soon suspects it may be more hell than haven.\n\nA harrowing taste of RoselandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrors convinces Odd that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to hit the road again. Still, the prescient Annamaria insists that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been led there for a reason, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised to do his best for the ghost on horseback. Just how deep and dreadful are the mysteries Roseland and her masters have kept for nearly a century? And what consequences await whoever is brave, or mad, enough to confront the most profound breed of evil? Odd only knows. Like his acclaimed creator, the irresistible Odd Thomas is in top-notch formÃ¢â‚¬â€as he takes on what may well be the most terrifying challenge yet in his curious career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750e0d1aa3178017ca74a06c5b140c537f1f0cf5","amp;dn":"dean.koontz.odd.apocalypse.2012.unabridged.audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750e0d1aa3178017ca74a06c5b140c537f1f0cf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,14,13,26,163,23,128,23,202,116,160,108,91,20,12,83,127,31,12,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
