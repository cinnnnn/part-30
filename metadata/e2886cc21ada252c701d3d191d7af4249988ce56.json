At the time Little Rock was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Sitting at the intersection of two major interstates from Los Angeles and New York, it had become a haven for drug trafficking. The documentary brought much attention to the problems in the city and as a result the Little Rock Police force was quadrupled. As a result the street gang problem was nearly eradicated.\n\nMORE INFO HERE: www.gangwar.com\n                www.imdb.com/title/tt0272104/\n\nThis torrent contains 2 flv files of the movie.\n\n(sorry the sync is off for the part 2.\nto fix this while watching use vlc media player\nand as soon as the video starts hold control and hit L eight times.\nit will say audio delay -400ms. that should fix the problem.)\n\n\nUPPED BY: Takeit4free :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2886cc21ada252c701d3d191d7af4249988ce56","amp;dn":"Gang+War%3A+Bangin%5C%27+in+Little+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2886cc21ada252c701d3d191d7af4249988ce56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,136,108,194,26,218,37,44,112,29,61,25,29,122,244,36,153,136,206,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
