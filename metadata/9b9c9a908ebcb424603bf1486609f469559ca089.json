Donkey Kong Country was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Shigeru Miyamoto, the character's original creator. It was produced by Tim Stamper instead, although Miyamoto was still involved with the project.[1]\nFollowing an intense marketing campaign, Donkey Kong Country received very high critical praise and sold over nine million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling Super Nintendo game. The game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color on November 20, 2000, the Game Boy Advance on June 9, 2003 and the Virtual Console on February 19, 2007. The game, along with its sequels, were taken off the Virtual Console on November 2012 in the United States without notice, and November 25, 2012 in Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9c9a908ebcb424603bf1486609f469559ca089","amp;dn":"Donkey+Kong+Country+snes+%5Bmindcrasher%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9c9a908ebcb424603bf1486609f469559ca089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,156,154,144,142,188,180,36,96,59,241,72,102,9,244,105,85,156,160,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
