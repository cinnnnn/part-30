But the act soon starts to haunt him: keeping the secret from his wife forces him into a kind of emotional poker, and his conscience does not cooperate very long in his betrayal of his own moral standards. A &quot;Balkan version of Crime and Punishment&quot;, wrote director Srdan GoluboviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡, set against the backdrop of a transition process gone awry: &quot;a modern 'film noir' about post-Milosevic Serbia, where there is no more war, just a moral and existential desert.&quot; GoluboviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ vividly dissects personality transformations from the perspective of a confession, always showing great respect for his protagonists. With its distinctive language of images, which finds a style of its own between close-ups and the representation of urban architecture, the film reveals an artistic approach to the theme that points beyond empty metaphors to the personal quality of the story -- a story whose pull can't be resisted.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Klopka.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,486,788,608 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:42:29\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 712x384 (AR: 1.854)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1730 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.211 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478813/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478813/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSerbian audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the Film Movement DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7a1101f1094281c18c84032c520f154043ecb5","amp;dn":"Srdan+Golubovic+-+Klopka++aka+The+Trap+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7a1101f1094281c18c84032c520f154043ecb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,122,17,1,241,9,66,129,193,140,132,3,44,82,15,21,64,67,236,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
