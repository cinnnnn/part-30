The day of the show they were \n\nreally strict about it, I witnessed people getting kicked out for taking \n\npictures with their smartphones. Security was very tight, which is why the \n\nfootage is not steady at all times, I was constantly watching out for \n\nsecurity with my one eye and sometimes hiding the camera as there was one \n\nguard in front of me who would keep turning back very often. The first few \n\nsongs have no video footage due to security, you can hear the audio though \n\nwith a black screen, the footage resumes halfway through Sorry and gets \n\nreally watcable around If The World.\nI did not intend it to be shaky/obstructed, blame the anal security for \n\nthat, I've shot really great video with every other band I taped. I've \n\nsynced BurnBoy's second audio source to the video since I felt it was the \n\nbest sounding one, the original audio has been removed. All in all, this is \n\nthe only GNR Video that has surfaced from the 2010 North American shows. \n\nMaybe tapers are holding off footage from other 2010 North American shows \n\nor maybe they don't exist. Whatever the case is, Canada/Japan got the best \n\nsetlists and a shame that very little footage exists.\n\nRequests:\nGuns N' Roses - 1992.09.13 Toronto, ON, Canada (Audio - All sources)\n\nSetlist:\nIntro*\nChinese Democracy*\nWelcome To The Jungle*\nIt's So Easy*\nMr. Brownstone*\nSorry**\nBetter**\nRichard Fortus Guitar Solo**\nLive and Let Die**\nIf the World\nInstrumental Jam\nDizzy Reed Piano Solo\nStreet Of Dreams\nRocket Queen\nCatcher in the Rye\nDJ Ashba Guitar Solo\nSweet Child O' Mine\nInstrumental Jam\nAxl Rose Piano Solo\nNovember Rain\nBumblefoot Guitar Solo\nYou Could Be Mine\nKnockin' On Heaven's Door\nNightrain\nShackler's Revenge\nMadagascar\nThis I Love\nParadise City\n\n\n* = no video footage, only audio with black screen\n** = obstructed video footage\n\nEnjoy!\n\n(tracker announce) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\noriginal files from dimeadozen\n\nEnjoy the dvd's!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61471bababfb4d65407c86f251ad6093874524c","amp;dn":"Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+2010-01-28+-+Toronto%2C+ON%2C+Canada+%5B3+DVDs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61471bababfb4d65407c86f251ad6093874524c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,20,113,186,186,191,180,214,84,7,200,111,37,26,214,9,56,116,82,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
