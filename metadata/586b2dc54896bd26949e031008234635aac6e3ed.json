Thank you\n\n\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof is the story of a Southern family in crisis, focusing on the turbulent relationship of a husband and wife, Brick and Margaret (who is almost always referred to as Maggie or \\&quot;Maggie the Cat\\&quot;), and their interaction with Brick\\'s family over the course of one evening gathering at the family estate in Mississippi. The party is, ostensibly, to celebrate the birthday of patriarch \\&quot;Big Daddy\\&quot; Pollitt, \\&quot;the Delta\\'s biggest cotton-planter\\&quot;[4] and that he has returned from the Oschner Clinic with a clean bill of health. In reality, all family members (except Big Daddy and his wife, Big Mama) are aware that Big Daddy is dying of cancer and have lied to Big Daddy and Big Mama to spare them any pain on his birthday.\n\nMaggie, though witty and beautiful, has escaped a childhood of desperate poverty to marry into the wealthy Pollitt family, but finds herself unfulfilled. The whole family is aware that Brick has not slept with Maggie in a long time, and it is putting an intense strain on their marriage. Brick, an aging football hero, further infuriates her by ignoring his brother Gooper\\'s attempts to gain control of the family fortune. Brick\\'s indifference and his near-continuous drinking dates back to the recent suicide of his friend Skipper, and Maggie fears that Brick\\'s malaise will ensure that Gooper and his wife Mae will end up with Big Daddy\\'s inheritance.\n\n\n\n\n\nCat On A Hot Tin Roof(1958) DVDrip h264 AVC High L3.0 -Classic-.mp4\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Nero Digital AVC HDTV Profile\nCodec ID                         : ndxh\nFile size                        : 1.64 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 176 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2010-09-04 09:05:54\nTagged date                      : UTC 2010-09-04 17:51:14\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
