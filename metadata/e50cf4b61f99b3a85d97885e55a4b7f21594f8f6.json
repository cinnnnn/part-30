When a sniper shoots dead Joan Flanders (think Jane Fonda) and three other victims associated with the 1960s peace movement, the FBI decides the killer is the most famous sniper in America, Carl Hitchcock, who's gone nuts and decided to up his total number of kills. Swagger soon realizes that Hitchcock, a fellow ex-Marine and Vietnam vet, is innocent, while the real killer, who's using cutting-edge, electronic sniper gear, is still at large. After two inferior Bob Lee Swagger books, The 47th Samurai (2007) and Night of Thunder (2008), Hunter is back at the top of his game. He's the best on the subject of guns and what damage bullets can do to human flesh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50cf4b61f99b3a85d97885e55a4b7f21594f8f6","amp;dn":"Stephen+Hunter+-+I+Sniper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50cf4b61f99b3a85d97885e55a4b7f21594f8f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,12,244,182,31,153,179,168,93,151,136,94,85,164,183,242,21,148,248,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
