PE Explorer can handle a variety of different \n PE file types: EXE, DLL, SYS, MSSTYLES, CPL, OCX, BPL, DPL, SCR and more \n (including executable files that run on MS Windows CE platform).\n PE Explorer gives you the power to look inside these PE binary files, perform static analysis, \n reveal a lot of information about the function of the executable, and collect as much information \n about the executable file as possible, without executing it. \n\n PE Explorer contains a whole host of tools: PE Header Viewer, Section Editor, \n Exported/Imported API Function List Viewer, Syntax Lookup, Digital Signature Viewer, \n Resource Viewer/Editor, Dependency Scanner, and Disassembler. \n\n On top of all that, PE Explorer has one of the best UPX Unpackers built in. \n The open API allows custom plug-ins to be integrated.\n\n\n PE Explorer is a multi-purpose PE (portable executable) file editor and binary \n header analysis tool for Windows developers. It tells you just about every little \n detail you could possibly want to know about a PE file (exe, dll, ActiveX, and \n several other executable formats). PE Explorer comes with a Visual Resource \n Editor, PE Header Viewer, Exported/Imported API Function Viewer, API Function \n Syntax Lookup, Dependency Scanner and Easy Disassembler. \n\n XP Visual Style Manifest Wizard allows your application to take advantage \n of the new common control styles and appearances featured in Windows XP.\n\n Sometimes you need to look inside of a program to figure out what&amp;#039;s going on. \n PE Explorer is a program for doing just such looking on Windows Portable Executable\n (PE) files. PE Explorer will let you open up any .exe or .dll file and plunge \n right into the belly of the program. Once inside, file structure can be analyzed,\n problems diagnosed, changes made and resources repaired. You can check out \n resources (bitmaps, icons, strings, etc) and make modifications without needing \n to recompile. The product also allows you to edit the properties of controls on\n Delphi forms within the PE file (there&amp;#039;s a very strong emphasis on peeking inside\n Delphi applications and packages).\n\nDecember 2007 Plugins + PE Explorer Helper DLL updated (see homepage download)\nLast fullversion patched PE Explorer v1.99 R2 program exe from Bokiv RELEASE DATE: 27.09.2007 embedded in setup.\n\n 1.99 R2 (08/17/2007)\n\n\tGeneral:\n\t+ Added the NsPack Unpacker plug-in.\n\t* Bugfix: PE Explorer would occasionally raise an exception on \n\t  startup if the logfile was corrupted.\n\t* Minor tweaks and improvements.\n\n\tResource editor:\n\t* Bugfix: when displaying multilingual StringTables the string \n\t  indices would be displayed incorrectly.\n\n\tUPX Unpacker plug-in:\n\t+ Now supports for UPX v3.01.\n\t+ Now supports for LZMA compression method.\n\t+ Now supports for scrambled files originally compressed by UPX v3.01.\n\t* Minor improvements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978d5bc1469cc07a6aae4cc4437e72b24d842c75","amp;dn":"PE+Explorer+v1.99+R2+REGISTERED+-+December+2007+release+FullVers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978d5bc1469cc07a6aae4cc4437e72b24d842c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,141,91,193,70,156,192,122,106,174,76,196,67,126,114,178,77,132,44,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
