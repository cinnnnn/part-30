It is his third album as a principal performer. It is named for a park in Plymouth, England, where the Sabbath Day Fight is commemorated.\nThis edition was released on 21 August 2006 under Lakeman's new record company, Relentless. There are a number of differences between the first and second editions of the album. The track listing is more or less the same, but with a slightly different order and the addition of the bonus track &quot;Send Yourself Away&quot;, from his first album, The Punch Bowl. Two of the tracks, &quot;Lady of the Sea (Hear Her Calling)&quot; and &quot;The White Hare&quot; have been remixed. In addition the second edition does not include the bonus disc and the cover design is different from the previous edition.\n\nThe second edition charted at #32 in the UK Top 40 and at #19 in the HMV Album Chart on 29 August 2006.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/seth-lakeman/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/seth-lakeman/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ff68c9e7475e485a6437bafcb62569b219d347","amp;dn":"Seth+Lakeman...Freedom+Fields%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ff68c9e7475e485a6437bafcb62569b219d347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,255,104,201,231,71,94,72,90,100,55,186,252,182,37,105,178,25,211,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
