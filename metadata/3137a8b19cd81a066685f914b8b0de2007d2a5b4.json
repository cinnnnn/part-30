It is an unforgiving environment, where forty-five-foot vessels contend with fifty-foot waves and gale-force winds. Where one fish can earn you $50,000, and one mistake can cost you your life. Swords takes us out to sea in pursuit of massive blue-fin tuna and the elusive swordfish. Together with the fathers, sons, old salts and greenhorns for whom the ocean is more than just where they make a living: it's a way of life.\n\nSEASON 1\n\nEpisode 1 - Voyage to Hell\nEpisode 2 - Blood on The Deck\nEpisode 3 - Hostile Takeover\nEpisode 4 - Man Overboard\nEpisode 5 - Homesick\nEpisode 6 - Making Waves\nEpisode 7 - A Perfect Storm\nEpisode 8 - Pay Out\n\nSEASON 2\n\nEpisode 1 - Grand Banks or Bust\nEpisode 2 - Deckhands Down\nEpisode 3 - Turf War\nEpisode 4 - Overloaded and Into the Storm\nEpisode 5 - So Close But So Far\nEpisode 6 - Man Overboard!\nEpisode 7 - Needle and Thread to the Head\nEpisode 8 - Trapped\nEpisode 9 - What Happened on the Back Deck?\nEpisode 10 - What It Takes to Be a Fisherman\n\nSEASON 3\n\nEpisode 1 - Gamblers and Legends\nEpisode 2 - Long Lines and Short Tempers\nEpisode 3 - The Storm of the Century\nEpisode 4 - With Friends Like These\nEpisode 5 - Charlie Foxtrot\nEpisode 6 - Foreign Relations\nEpisode 7 - Bested, Battered and Broke\nEpisode 8 - Dead In the Water\nEpisode 9 - Lost Hope and Lost Chances\nEpisode 10 - The Final Gamble\n\nThanks to momentum for the bulk of these shows.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3137a8b19cd81a066685f914b8b0de2007d2a5b4","amp;dn":"Swords%3A+Life+on+the+Line+++%28Seasons+1-3++-++Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3137a8b19cd81a066685f914b8b0de2007d2a5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,55,168,177,156,216,26,6,102,133,249,20,184,176,222,32,7,210,165,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
