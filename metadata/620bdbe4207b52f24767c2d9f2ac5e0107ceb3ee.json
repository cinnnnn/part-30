Johnson. Accompanied by pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Max Roach, Johnson alternates standards such as &quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; with originals, including the two part &quot;Blue Trombone,&quot; and shows listeners why he is still considered one of the greatest jazz trombonists of all time. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nTracklist: \n\n01.
