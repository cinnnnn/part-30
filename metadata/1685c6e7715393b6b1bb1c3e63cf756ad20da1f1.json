Now, one year later, the merciless aliens have crushed the planet's armed forces and annihilated all freedom fighters. All but one: SGT Coleman is Earth's last hope. If he can find Sf-92 then maybe, just maybe, he can use it against the alien conquerors and win mankind's freedom. His search brings him to Clay County: a backward, redneck slice of the deep south that is completely unaware - or too drunk to care - of humanity's subjugation by an alien army. Together with the unlikely allies of Clay County citizens Blake, Vern, Hot Dog, and Root, Coleman sets out to find Sf-92 before the Earth's otherworldly overlords, save mankind, and drink a few cold ones along the way!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1685c6e7715393b6b1bb1c3e63cf756ad20da1f1","amp;dn":"Clay+County","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1685c6e7715393b6b1bb1c3e63cf756ad20da1f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,133,198,231,113,83,147,182,177,187,28,62,99,207,117,106,210,13,161,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
