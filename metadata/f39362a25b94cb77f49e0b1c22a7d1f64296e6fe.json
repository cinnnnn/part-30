All it takes is one click of the mouse to perform a comprehensive suite of tests on your computer's hardware and attached drives. TechTool Pro does it all. There is no need to purchase additional software to keep your computer performing at its best. In fact, it's so good that Apple includes a copy of its sibling, TechTool Deluxe, in its AppleCare Protection Plan.\n\nDiagnostics and Repair Use the Check Computer feature to perform a complete diagnostics check of the computer and the Macintosh formatted hard drives with one click of the mouse. This includes a SMART test of the computer's built-in hard drive to check for impending drive failure, a test of the computer's available RAM, a check of the disk directories, and much more. If problems are found, advice is provided on how to proceed to repair the problem. Use Check Computer regularly as a part of a preventive maintenance program.\n\nVolume Rebuild In addition to testing the disk directories of hard drives, TechTool Pro can also perform a complete rebuild of them. This optimizes these critical data structures and, on a corrupted drive, repair any problems. Use volume rebuild to keep your hard drives operating at their peak performance.\n\nOptimization TechTool Pro performs both file and volume optimization. File optimization consolidates each individual file into a contiguous area of the hard drive. Volume optimization consolidates the free space on a hard drive. Optimizing enhances the overall performance of your drives and simplifies the file storage layout.\n\nData Recovery TechTool Pro includes several methods of data recovery. Use them to recover data from corrupted drives that don't mount on the desktop and save the data to another location. Use the Trash History feature to track the location of deleted files and increase the chance of their recovery in the case of an accidental deletion.\n\neDrive One of the unique features of TechTool Pro is the eDrive. This is a bootable Mac OS X partition containing TechTool Pro and a small copy of your system that you can use when performing regular maintenance or in the case of an emergency. It is created on one of your hard drives without the need to reformat it.\n\nProtection TechTool Pro includes the option to install the TechTool Protection system preference. This is where you configure automatic functions that operate in the background. In particular, you can configure Protection to track deleted files, monitor the free space on your hard drives, save backups of critical directory data to help with recovery in the event of drive corruption, and to monitor the SMART routines of your hard drives. If problems are found, Protection provides an onscreen alert and can even be configured to send an email alert.\n\n* System Requirements:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PowerPC G4 processor or newer.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OS X 10.4.9 or greater.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OS X 10.5 or greater for eDrive creation on active startup volume.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DVD-ROM drive.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 512 Megabytes RAM or higher.\n\nHome Page - http://micromat.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39362a25b94cb77f49e0b1c22a7d1f64296e6fe","amp;dn":"TechTool.Pro.v6.0.3.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39362a25b94cb77f49e0b1c22a7d1f64296e6fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,147,98,162,91,148,203,119,244,158,11,28,34,167,209,246,66,150,230,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
