But it took his young daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depiction of a swastika on an imaginary family shield - the swastika representing Germany - for Giles to uncover the incredible, dark story of his own family and his father-in-lawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life under HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regime.\n\nAs German citizens during World War II, Wolfram and his Bohemian, artist parents survived one of the most brutal eras of history. Wolfram, who was only nine years old when Hitler came to power, lived through the rise and fall of the Third Reich, from the earliest street marches to the final defeat of the Nazi regime. Conscripted into Hitler's army, he witnessed the brutality of war - first on the Russian front and then on the Normandy beaches. \n\nSeen through German eyes and written with remarkable sensitivity, The Boy Who Went to War is a powerful story of warfare and human survival and a reminder to us all that civilians on both sides suffered the consequences of HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf94eb9a1ae1e0c64550277ffbfb3793f6a67f61","amp;dn":"The+Boy+Who+Went+to+War+-+The+Story+of+a+Reluctant+German+Soldie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf94eb9a1ae1e0c64550277ffbfb3793f6a67f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,148,235,154,26,225,224,198,69,80,39,127,251,251,55,147,246,166,127,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
