(I have never understood the reasoning behind limited editions.  It may create a buzz and/or a feeding frenzy to latch onto a copy, but the only people who come out ahead are the ones who buy it in order to resell it at an inflated price.  And most of the fans lose.)  The few torrents I could find were dead, but, a few years ago, I was finally able to track it down from a link on a message board to a file-sharing site, so my thanks to the original uploader.  The second disc contained the tracks from the Surface Patterns single and the Millennium single.\r\n\r\nThe simple guitar riff by Devin Townsend in Sex Offender is one of my all-time favorites from any artist, but the 8-minute version is too long, so I also included an edit with over three minutes of the beginning random samples cut off.  If you feel this is sacrilegious, you're more than welcome to delete it and forget it ever existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1-1 Vigilante    6:28  \r\n1-2 Millennium     6:10  \r\n1-3 Liquid Separation     5:05  \r\n1-4 Search And Destroy    6:30  \r\n1-5 Surface Patterns     5:35  \r\n1-6 Victim Of A Criminal    6:31  \r\n1-7 Division Of Mind    5:47  \r\n1-8 This Faith     6:11  \r\n1-9 Plasma Springs    6:20  \r\n1-10 Sex Offender    8:12  \r\n1-11 Sex Offender edit    4:44\r\n\r\n2-1 Surface Patterns (Surveillance Remix)      5:53  \r\n2-2 Surface Patterns (Chemical Cauldron Remix)     7:38  \r\n2-3 Internal Combustion      5:37  \r\n2-4 Surface Patterns (Scarification Remix)      4:35  \r\n2-5 Millennium (1000 Years Of Decay Remix)      6:19  \r\n2-6 Millennium (Left In Ruins Remix)      7:52  \r\n2-7 Transtime  5:58  \r\n2-8 Millennium (Until Death Remix)       4:43  \r\n\r\nmp3 at 320\r\n\r\n***********************\r\n\r\nGrab and go is never cool.  Please help keep these torrents alive.  Whenever you grab a torrent, you should continue to seed for others, at least until your ratio reaches 1.0 or higher.  I'm still kind of new to this, but I believe that if you make any changes to the files you've downloaded or if you move them from their original download location, it will stop seeding.  I usually COPY my music files from my download folder to an empty folder on my desktop, rename them how I like, then add them to my music library.  This leaves the torrent in its original condition and location so it will seed for others.\r\n\r\nWe've all been frustrated by dead and incomplete torrents.  This wouldn't happen if everyone seeded until their ratio got well over 1 for every individual torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4926f1da63c8104f0c1b9d297c6672274cc74b27","amp;dn":"Front+Line+Assembly%2C+FLA%2C+Millennium%2C+2007+remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4926f1da63c8104f0c1b9d297c6672274cc74b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,38,241,218,99,200,16,79,12,27,157,41,124,102,114,39,76,199,75,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
