After the mysterious events in the year 4089, the Overlord hasn't been heard from for the last millennium, and so the experimental robots have continued to wage war according to their program. Without the Overlord to repair the damage, Xax has fallen into a state of chaos and dereliction. However, a shadowy new power has risen... how will your presence turn its fate?\r\nShoot, sneak, build, talk, slash, buy, sell, fly, swing, hover, scavenge, teleport &amp; conquer your way through an endlessly generated planet. You can do it all with a friend, too. 5089 includes a rework of 3089 &amp; does not require the original to play.\r\n\r\nUpdate v1.55\r\n\r\nFixed a crash when building structures in otherwise empty areas. \r\nImproved the map cursor, especially in virtual reality. \r\nAdded a 5089-novr.bat launcher that will run the game without virtual reality, even if a headset is detected. \r\nUpdated mouse control system in virtual reality; Vive cursor control should be more reliable even if the 5089 window isn't on top. \r\nDisabled ambient occlusion &amp; cartoon effects while in the map, which helps map performance (the effects generally are not seen anyway from a distance).\r\n\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen '5089 v1.55.exe' , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtract it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB  page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a63fee3593c571e8af6589249e37b81b23e8f76a","amp;dn":"5089+The+Action+RPG+version+1.55+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a63fee3593c571e8af6589249e37b81b23e8f76a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,63,238,53,147,197,113,232,175,101,137,36,158,55,184,27,35,232,247,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
