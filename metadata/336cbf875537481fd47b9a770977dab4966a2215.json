Without mastering, a mix can sound dull and lifeless. Single tracks sometimes do not fit together with other tracks because of differences in the dynamics or the frequency characteristics.\n\nThe Steinberg Mastering Edition is a set of six high-quality plug-ins for various VST- and DirectX-based host audio applications, which together satisfy all your mastering effect needs. Whatever the situation, the Steinberg Mastering Edition offers the tools needed - in the quality you expect of Steinberg Spectral Design audio software.\n\nME Loudness Maximizer is a specialized effect designed to boost signals as well as increase the perceived level of the audio signal.\n\nME Spectralizer enhances and synthesizes high-end frequencies to and that special sparkle to the audio.\n\nME FreeFilter is a 30-band equalizer that can analyze the EQ curve of an existing audio file, and match that for a different one. This is accomplished with the Learn-Source/Destination fuction.\n\nThe ME Compressor is a multi-band equalizing compressor with up to five different freely-adjustable bands. This allows you to tighten bottom-end frequencies, while making the higher frequencies crisper and give your sound more punch.\n\nNext, we provided two top-notch analysis tools - the ME SpectroGraph which allows you to pin-point specific trouble frequencies so that you can take them out with some careful notch filtering.\nThe ME PhaseScope will immideatly display any phase issues that are present in a mix, as well as displaying signal energy in the stereo field.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n Intel Pentium II / AMD Athlon 200 MHz (400 MHz or better recommended)\n32 MB RAM (256 recomended)\nWindows 98 / ME / 2000 / XP\nCubase VST 3.7 (or higher), Cubase SX/SL, Nuendo or any other VST 2.0 or DirectX compatible application\nASIO 2.0 / Windows MME / DirectSound soundcard\n\nME Loudness Maximizer\n\nME Spectralizer\n\nME FreeFilter\n\nME Compressor\n\nME PhaseScope and ME SpectroGraph ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336cbf875537481fd47b9a770977dab4966a2215","amp;dn":"Steinberg+Mastering+Edition+v1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336cbf875537481fd47b9a770977dab4966a2215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,108,191,135,85,55,72,31,212,123,154,119,9,119,218,180,150,106,34,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
