She was once a rich orphan and aviatrix whose plane crashed over an African jungle. After fashioning a bikini from a dead giraffe, Joan replaced Nurla, the white goddess of a local tribe after defeating a starving leopard armed only with a dagger. She spent seven years surviving the jungle with her pet panther, Saber. Rulah is proficient in hand-to-hand combat, jungle magic, and wrestling. Her loyalty to her region of the jungle is undying, and she has chosen never to return to the U.S. She had a boyfriend named Tim Pointer who had amnesia, but later found Rulah and was saved from the villainous Sivo, a rival jungle girl. Rulah convinced Tim though she had no interest in going home and marrying him.\nRulah's enemies included Sivo, Black Fury (Villain), Nisba the Witch Doctor, Miss Hogge, and Hagga.\n\nGolden Age Appearances \n\nZoot Comics #7-16\nRulah, Jungle Goddess #17-27\nAll Top Comics #8-18\nJungle Thrills #16\nTerrors of the Jungle #4,8,17\nGhostly Weird Stories #122\nSpook #28\n\n\nThis upload only includes Rulah's self titled book\n\nseed for all to enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:242bf045a80f0bf5dc80484a9c15aa99cf981707","amp;dn":"Rulah%2C+Jungle+Goddess++1947+fox+Feature+Syndicate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"242bf045a80f0bf5dc80484a9c15aa99cf981707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,43,240,69,168,15,11,245,220,128,72,74,156,21,170,153,207,152,23,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
