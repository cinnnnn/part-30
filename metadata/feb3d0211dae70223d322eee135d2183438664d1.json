An ABC press release described The Unusuals as &quot;like a modern-day M*A*S*H&quot; that &quot;explores both the grounded drama and comic insanity of the world of New York City police detectives, where every cop has a secret&quot;.\n\n    Detective Casey Shraeger (Amber Tamblyn) has just been transferred to the NYPD's Homicide unit from Vice and is instantly thrown into a setting of bullets and bodies. As she begins her new assignment, Casey finds that the squad is full of secrets, which serves her well, since she's keeping a few of her own.\n\nThe pilot and first episode were written by Noah Hawley, a former writer and producer for Fox's Bones.\n\nThe initial series order was for 10 episodes. Show creator Noah Hawley announced via his Twitter account in mid-May 2009 that ABC would not be bringing the show back for a second season.\n\nStars: Amber Tamblyn, Jeremy Renner and Harold Perrineau\n\nNOTE: I like it very much, weird, funny and 'unusual' cop-show, I even have it burned on DVDR.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb3d0211dae70223d322eee135d2183438664d1","amp;dn":"The.Unusuals.Season.Completed.480p.WEB-DL.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb3d0211dae70223d322eee135d2183438664d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,179,208,33,29,174,112,34,61,50,46,238,19,93,33,131,67,134,100,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
