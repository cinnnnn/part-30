If few recognize that distinction, then it's because the Brothers Four were also part of a largely forgotten chapter in the history of folk music in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brothers-four-p1930/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nThe two most accessible studio LPs by the Brothers Four slot together perfectly, and are ideal artifacts of their era: upbeat and enjoyable (and totally inauthentic) presentations of folk songs and folk-type songs. The debut album is weighted just a bit toward novelty-type tunes -- or at least folk material done in the style of novelty tunes -- such as &quot;The Zulu Warrior&quot; and &quot;Sama Kama Wacky Brown,&quot; and calypso. B.M.O.C.'s 12 songs are more diverse and sung with greater subtlety and sophistication, and constitute the group's best work on album. The range of material on this disc (which includes the hits &quot;Greenfields&quot; and &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot;) makes this an excellent alternative to either the best-of or the greatest hits collection released on the group.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r351936&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r351936&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nThe Brothers Four\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nAs folk revival albums go, this one is tame but very upbeat and well sung, treading a fine line midway between the Kingston Trio and Mitch Miller &amp; the Gang. Side one shows a strong calypso and Carribean influence, and also offers a pair of novelty-style tunes, while side two is weighted more toward traditional American folk material. That material is more beguiling and playful, and serves as a beautiful showcase for the quartet's harmony singing -- rousing, straightforward vocalizing on &quot;Hard Travelin'&quot; (which seems like the template for the New Christy Minstrels' sound) and the melodic sea shanty &quot;Eddystone Light,&quot; the gorgeous multi-layered arrangement of &quot;Darlin', Won't You Wait,&quot; and the moody chart hit &quot;Greenfields.&quot; It's all nicely sung and produced in a restrained style that makes inventive but unobtrusive use of stereo separation. The album seems tame and predictable today but, in 1960, this was what folk music was in the minds of most listeners, and this isn't a bad example of the form.\n\n1960 [12 tracks]\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95987&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95987&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nB.M.O.C., Best Music On/Off Campus\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nArguably the quartet's best studio album, B.M.O.C. offers a rich selection of material, from traditional folk songs to '30s blues (&quot;St. James Infirmary&quot;) and then-current country songs (&quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot;), all sung in a serious and restrained style. The difference between this and the group's earlier albums is that, as individuals, the members all show a greater depth in their understanding of the songs on B.M.O.C., feeling the lyrics as well as singing them well. Thus, even the movie song &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot; (from the movie The Alamo) is presented with a great deal of emotion that was missing from earlier work by the group, and &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Little Bird&quot; is offered with a fervor and immediacy (and some nice flourishes on the guitars and banjo) that characterized the folk revival at its best. The title, incidentally, is a play on a phrase that would have been well-known in 1961 (though it dates from at least the 1920s) but is utterly forgotten today -- B.M.O.C. meant &quot;Big Man On Campus,&quot; a reference usually applied to a male undergraduate of some renown, usually in sports.\n\n1961 [12 tracks]\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95989&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r95989&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000064FB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000064FB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
