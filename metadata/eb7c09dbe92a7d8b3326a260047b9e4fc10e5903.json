The reader will find much useful information on the characteristics of fuels, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear and others, along with proper methods for handling them and their residues. Also extensively covered are internal combustion engines, steam turbines, and reciprocating steam engines. Feedwater treatment, ash removal reliability, operation and maintenance considerations are all examined in detail. The second edition expands coverage of gasification of coal, gas turbines and effective use of generation in place of efficiency measures.\n\n# Hardcover: 269 pages\n# Publisher: Fairmont Press; 3 edition (November 3, 2005)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0849395119\n# ISBN-13: 978-0849395116","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7c09dbe92a7d8b3326a260047b9e4fc10e5903","amp;dn":"Guide+to+Electric+Power+Generation%2C+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7c09dbe92a7d8b3326a260047b9e4fc10e5903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,124,9,219,233,42,125,139,51,38,162,96,4,123,158,79,193,14,89,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
