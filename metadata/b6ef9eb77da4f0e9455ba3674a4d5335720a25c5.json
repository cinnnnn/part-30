While overcoming suspicion and ambition within the kungfu school, Chen exhumes his master to prove Hou's defeat was the result of poisoning. Both nationalities make the case a test of honor, so Chinese and Japanese pride are at stake when it culminates in Chen's final epic duel against the ruthless, undefeated Japanese general Fujita.\n\n\n                         ENJOY..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                  AND...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    PLEASE SEED.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ef9eb77da4f0e9455ba3674a4d5335720a25c5","amp;dn":"Fist+of+Legend+%281994%29Jet+Li.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ef9eb77da4f0e9455ba3674a4d5335720a25c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,239,158,183,125,164,240,233,69,91,163,103,74,77,83,53,114,10,37,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
