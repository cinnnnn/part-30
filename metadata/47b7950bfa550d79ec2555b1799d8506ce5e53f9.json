The Crease\n02. Pages\n03. Saint Forgot\n04. Should've Been There\n05. Front Seat\n06. Failure\n07. Little Steve\n08. GB: The True Story\n09. Mountain State\n10. 40s\n11. The Carry\n\nFor a band that, for the most part, had nothing more than a free album and an EP out, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve jumped on these guysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bandwagon, moved to the front row and bought the fucking t-shirt. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve called them your new favorite band, one of the brightest up and coming spots in this genre, and even insinuated that Two Cow might wanna watch their back when it comes to these kids. High praise, no doubt but about 3 months ago, when I got my copy of Simple Machines I immediately knew that the rain of praise from the 9b camp wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only high, it was wholly accurate.\n\nFor months IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been chomping at the bit to tell yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢all about this album and how incredibly awesome it is and now that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m at a loss. What do I say that I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already repeated ad nauseum on twitter andI mean, how many times can I say that if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of Two Cow Garage you absolutely have to get this cd?\n\nThat raw edge that Dance To Forget and Truckstop Roses (both are available for free here and here) had has definitely been dialed down a little with Simple Machines, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more a result of studio production than a softening band. Everything else about Simple Machines is spot-fucking-on. Including the incredibly well timed cameos of other 9b faves such as Two CowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Micah, Drag The RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Snodgrass and Lizzie HuffmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lizzie.\n\nSo thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it. I ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got nothing else to say. If you like that punky, rocky, Southerny rock and roll thing, then meet Arliss Nancy, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re one of your new favorite bands. Simple Machines is an album IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll talk about again come year end lists. Simple Machines is an album IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll still be listening to a year from now. Simple Machines is Essential Listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b7950bfa550d79ec2555b1799d8506ce5e53f9","amp;dn":"Arliss+Nancy+-+Simple+Machines+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b7950bfa550d79ec2555b1799d8506ce5e53f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,183,149,11,250,85,13,121,236,37,85,177,121,157,133,6,206,94,83,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
