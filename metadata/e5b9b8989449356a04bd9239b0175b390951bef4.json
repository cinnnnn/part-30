These DVDs were a pleasant surprise. No filtering required at all from what I could tell. Just progressive video completely free of any rainbows, dot crawl, combing, etc. No artifacts or issues of any kind. Only the one special feature video required IVTC.\n\nI chose not to degrain anything at all, which explains the high file size. If you want something smaller, there's another season one torrent on here that will most likely suit you just fine.\n\nThese are best viewed with CCCP.\n\n-\n\nVideo: 10-bit x264, 1578-4804kbps (Anamorphic 4:3)\nAudio: Untouched 2.0 AC3, 192kbps (Dual mono)\nNo subs of any kind\n\n\nIf enough people are interested, I'll gladly encode the rest of the series as I purchase the season DVDs. If you have any ISOs of the season DVDs or anything Gunsmoke related, feel free to upload those if you want.\n\nimagebam(dot)com/image/b603f2301080132\nimagebam(dot)com/image/8c5c84301080155\nimagebam(dot)com/image/c9fc33301080158","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b9b8989449356a04bd9239b0175b390951bef4","amp;dn":"Gunsmoke+Season+1+%5B10-bit+x264+AC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b9b8989449356a04bd9239b0175b390951bef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,185,184,152,148,73,53,106,4,189,146,57,176,23,91,57,9,81,190,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
