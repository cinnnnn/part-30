Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.\n\nEach weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\n&quot;Dreaming&quot; is a song by the American punk/new wave band Blondie. Released in 1979, it was the lead single from their fourth album Eat to the Beat. It peaked at #2 in the British singles chart.\n\n&quot;Dreaming&quot; was written by the group's principal songwriting partnership, Deborah Harry and Chris Stein.\n\nThe power pop sound of the record is one of its trademarks as is the opening line &quot;When I met you in the restaurant, you could tell I was no debutante&quot;. The song is also influenced by the popular Phil Spector phenomenon, the wall of sound, which utilizes multiple layers of the same various instruments to create a full and voluminous sound or atmosphere.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_(Blondie_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_(Blondie_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABIcAaDJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABIcAaDJ&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:32\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
