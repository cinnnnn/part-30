For more information on Suicidal Tendencies read about them on wikipedia:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso I have included all the releases for the band Infectious Grooves and Cyco Miko which are side projects of the band Suicidal Tendencies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_Grooves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_Grooves&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are also other things included. The whole lot is here, all the albums that are available. They're all in MP3 @ 320kbps CBR 44.1Khz. I have very carefully put this whole collection together so it is the most complete discography for Suicidal Tendencies and their side project bands that has ever been released!\n\nI did release a fair few of their albums before on Pirate Bay but that was a while ago. This is more up to date now, there has been some new releases. There might be some more releases in the future but I'm not sure. This is everything to date. I have even included the soundtrack to the new Suicidal Tendencies DVD which I have very carefully ripped myself to add to the collection.\n\nEverything you'll ever need for this band is in this discography making it the BEST one now, no other discography can compete with this as this is the best on the internet. All artwork has been tagged into each MP3 and I have included all the front and back covers that I can plus I have tagged all the tracks perfectly. It's good because they all match at the same quality like some of my other collections I have already made. I think 320kbps MP3 sounds good and is good enough to play on your MP3 player or whatever you listen to.\n\nDon't waste your time with the other discographies, those ones aren't tagged right and are missing lots of albums. This torrent is for all fans of Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Cyco Miko plus some of the other bands that appear in their collection.\n\nThis was a pleasure to make this, I hope that it will grow popular very quickly and that people will help to seed it well. If you do download remember that others will want to grab this also so don't forget to pass it on...\n\nHope you enjoy listening to these bands! Hope you enjoy my torrent, keep checking my torrents for any new releases that come up in the future. I make only the finest quality torrents, I organise them very well to make sure that the music is like it should be!\n\nHappy downloading!\n\nCyco Miko  1996 - Lost My Brain!
