'Kamasutrance Radio Show Vol 2' is the 2nd compilation which is now born from the great collaboration between DNA Records and Israel's leading music radio station Radio Darom.\n\nWe produced this full length CD so you can share it with the hundreds of thousands of our listeners the amazing experience they sense in each and every one of Ofir KamaSutrance broadcasts.\n\nYou're about to get on board through an adventure of riding sub sonic vibes with full elemental dubbish percussion artwork on the psychedelic highway.
