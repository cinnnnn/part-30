The syntax boxes are revised to show typical code examples rather than abstract notation. This includes optional example modules using Alice and Greenfoot. The examples feature annotations with dos and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ts along with cross references to more detailed explanations in the text. New tables show a large number of typical and cautionary examples. New programming and review problems are also presented that ensure a broad coverage of topics. In addition, Java 7 features are included to provide programmers with the most up-to-date information.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nNo one brews up a better Java guide than Cay Horstmann, and in this Fourth Edition of Big Java heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s created his best one yet. Thoroughly updated to include Java 7, this edition of HorstmannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best-selling text helps students absorb computing concepts and programming principles, develop strong problem-solving skills, and become better programmers, all while exploring the elements of Java that are needed to write real-life programs.In preparing the new edition, special attention was given to the quality and variety of exercise material- from skill-oriented multiple-choice questions to short code-completion exercises to multi-step lab exercises-offering instructors more ways to engage students at different levels, and providing more practice to students who need it.\n\nA top-notch introductory text for beginners, Big Java, Fourth Edition is also a thorough reference guide for students and professionals alike to Java technologies, Internet programming, database access, and many other areas of computer science.\n\nNEW TO THIS EDITION:\n\nHow To sections walk through the steps to solving a problem, and Worked Examples apply these steps to motivational examples such as credit-card processing.\nExamples Tables present a variety of uses and special cases in a compact format.\nCommon Errors, Tips, and Special Topics make it easy to refer back to topics when solving problems.\nAnnotated Syntax Boxes call out features of typical example code to draw studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attention to the key elements of the syntax.\nChapters have been revised to focus each section on a specific Learning Objective. Sections have been shortened to present the concepts and syntax and how they are applied.\nEarly chapters have been thoroughly revised to provide more examples and concrete analogies.\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
