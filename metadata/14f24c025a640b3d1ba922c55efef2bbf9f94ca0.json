Gary Patterson talked about the lore, mysteries, and conspiracies surrounding rock star deaths. The passing of music icon Prince &quot;is a terribly sad story,&quot; that along with the deaths of a number of generation-spanning artists is making 2016 an especially tragic year, he commented. Curiously, Prince had recently decided to write his autobiography and felt under a rush to do it, Patterson noted. Prince's ex-girlfriend and musical protege, Vanity, had just died two months ago, at the same age as Prince, 57.\r\n\r\nPatterson also spoke about the preponderance of rock star deaths at age 27, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and more recently Amy Winehouse. He pointed out the chilling numerological significance of 27, which translates as the number 9 (2 + 7 = 9), which represents accomplishment and being ready to leave or make a change. Patterson also talked about the occult interests of David Bowie, as well as a possible conspiracy involving the death of Hendrix. Jimi's death may have been orchestrated by his manager, who had taken out a two million dollar life insurance policy on him, he detailed\r\n \nhttp://www.rgarypatterson.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f24c025a640b3d1ba922c55efef2bbf9f94ca0","amp;dn":"Rock+Star+Deaths+Prince+Coast+to+Coast+april+21%2C2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f24c025a640b3d1ba922c55efef2bbf9f94ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,242,76,2,90,100,11,61,27,169,34,197,94,254,242,187,249,249,76,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
