What may come as more of a pleasant surprise is how melodic the album is and UlrichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift for an evocative lyrical metaphor. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Always DancingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, for example, he gives us the line Ã¢â‚¬Å“In photographs I hear your songÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life Amongst the Black SheepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which I first heard as part of the Orphee compilation, retains itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melodic power here.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/02/peter-ulrich/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/02/peter-ulrich/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada4fd7ee4601c0ccbdfa6ddee9c5d6a54a395ef","amp;dn":"Peter+Ulrich+-+Pathways+And+Dawns+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada4fd7ee4601c0ccbdfa6ddee9c5d6a54a395ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,164,253,126,228,96,28,12,203,223,166,221,238,156,93,106,84,163,149,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
