She was one of the early settlers sent over from England to Jamestown with the intention of establishing a thriving settlement that would enact lucrative trade systems with the local Powhatan tribe. Unfortunately, the alliance was precarious and provisions were in short supply.\r\nAs winter fell, the colony quickly crumbled. The Powhatan Indians were unwilling to help the settlers, killing anyone who ventured outside the fort to forage. Trapped behind their wooden palisades, supplies quickly dwindled - leading to tactics that were disgustingly primeval yet necessary for survival. Now, 400 years later, a cellar excavation has uncovered numerous bone fragments - all belonging to this adolescent female. More surprising than their location are the interesting cut marks on the lower jaw and front of the cranium. With the help of forensic anthropologists, the extraordinary and frightening story of this young woman comes to life.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen0.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen1.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen2.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen3.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen4.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen5.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen6.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen7.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/9/93/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen8.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen9.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen10.jpg http://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Jamestown-s-Dark-Winter-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1792 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 29.970 fps\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\r\n * Audio Quality: 0.48 48KHz (~140 Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 55mn 11s\r\n * Part Size: 763 MiB\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Released: 2015\r\n * Source: HDTV AVC 1080i\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Merged Subtitles: English\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/death-jamestown-background/1428/\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Pilgrims\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Colonial%20House\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=America%20Before%20Columbus\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Desperate%20Crossing%20-%20The%20Untold%20Story%20of%20the%20Mayflower\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20New%20World%3A%20Nightmare%20in%20Jamestown\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Jamestown's_Dark_Winter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8235edb0669295113ec02c941369551eb2e54b4a","amp;dn":"PBS.Secrets.of.the.Dead.2015.Jamestowns.Dark.Winter.720p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8235edb0669295113ec02c941369551eb2e54b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,53,237,176,102,146,149,17,62,192,44,148,19,105,85,30,178,229,75,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
