A lengthy battle ensues and Rama kills Ravana. \n\nRama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.\n\nOn meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her purity, since she had stayed at the demon\\'s palace. \n\nWhen Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, Agni the lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed, to the throne, attesting to her purity.\n\n\n\nI WILL POST ALL THE KANDAS ONE BY ONE...\n\nPLZ SEED THIS DIVINE TORRENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..\n\nYOU WILL BE ONE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF RAMAYANA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD...\n\nTHIS TORRENT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO HINDUS ONLY...\n\nANY ONE CAN SPREAD GOOD MESSAGE IF THEY HAVE NICE, PEACEFUL HEART..\n\nPLZ SEED GUYZ...\n\nTHANK YOU..\n\n\nPLZ SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..I AM LACKING SEEDS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24d72c71e4fc648c4b6aa4dc7dbcdc232fe37303","amp;dn":"Shrimad+Valmiki+Ramayana+-+Yuddha+Kanda+Purvardh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24d72c71e4fc648c4b6aa4dc7dbcdc232fe37303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,215,44,113,228,252,100,140,75,106,164,220,125,188,220,35,47,227,115,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
