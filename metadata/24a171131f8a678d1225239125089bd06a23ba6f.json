Moses is called by God to lead his people from Egypt to the promised land. A very reluctant prophet, feeling unworthy of the call, Moses accepts the task. After a series of plagues Memefta agrees to let the Hebrews go. With second thoughts, he pursues them to annihilation of his army in the parting of the Red Sea. Starvation is averted by manna from heaven, the ten commandments are given the people through Moses, they go astray with worship of the golden calf. Forty years of wandering in the wilderness, until finally they reach what will be their home (which Moses lives to see but not to enter).\n\nCTCA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a171131f8a678d1225239125089bd06a23ba6f","amp;dn":"Moses+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a171131f8a678d1225239125089bd06a23ba6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,161,113,19,31,138,103,141,18,37,35,145,37,8,155,208,106,35,186,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
