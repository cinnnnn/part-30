This was done in order to avoid a lawsuit from Kellogg\\&amp;#039;s over the Pop-Tarts trademark.\n\nThe publisher of the comic is Last Gasp and later Cherry Comics. Though the comic is largely known as an erotic or pornographic book, it does garner critical merit for occasional political commentary. The Cherry character has also appeared in several free speech/censorship awareness campaigns.\n\nWelz draws the comic in a simple style reminiscent of the Archie comic book series, though he does experiment with different drawing styles, including a 3D edition.\n\nThis is my first scan and torrent!
