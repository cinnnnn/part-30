Max Bemis is best known as the frontman for the successful SoCal pop-punk outfit Say Anything, while Sherri Dupree-Bemis is the singer for her long-standing family band, the Texas-based indie stars Eisley. After several years of marriage and the arrival of the couple's first child, the two decided to start a band together with the intention of recording all of the love songs they had written for each other. Perma's quirky, acoustic-driven, amorous pop-punk songs combine elements of each of the couple's better-known bands but focus largely on the interplay of their two voices and relating the story of their romance. Their debut record, Two of a Crime, was released in late 2013 on Max Bemis' Equal Vision imprint Rory Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b9f7ecea4e88710946b358b87a192747799006b","amp;dn":"Perma+-+Two+of+a+Crime+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b9f7ecea4e88710946b358b87a192747799006b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,159,126,206,164,232,135,16,148,107,53,139,135,161,146,116,119,153,0,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
