It has been 2 years since Jackie used his power to kill the guys responsible for his girlfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder. He has been unable to free himself of the memory of JennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death since bottling up The Darkness and now it wants out. A botched attempt to end JackieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life opens the door for The Darkness to reemerge and sets Jackie on a brutal journey as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motives of The Darkness.
