MPC is pure VBR and is designed to be as transparent as possible. \n\n----------------\n\nWinamp users:\n\nCopy in_mpc.dll to the Winamp plugins folder, then restart Winamp.\n\nMake sure you NEVER have the equalizer on when playing MPC!\nIt will mess up the sound, so make sure it\\&amp;#039;s OFF!\n\n--------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db6f07486a13f21c7116119f9f092e75fc218f4f","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+8+Original+Soundtrack+%5BEAC-MPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db6f07486a13f21c7116119f9f092e75fc218f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,111,7,72,106,19,242,28,113,22,17,159,159,9,46,117,252,33,143,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
