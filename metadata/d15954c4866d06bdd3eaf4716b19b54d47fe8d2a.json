Unfortunately, the software version of the LDOCE is rather unpleasant to use. It is very slow and has problems with basic features like scrolling and copying text. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why I created the LDOCE5 Viewer Ã¢â‚¬â€ a fast, user-friendly alternative that will make you want to look up words!\n\nNote: The LDOCE5 Viewer does not replace the LDOCE5. Before you can use it, you have to install the original LDOCE5 software from the DVD-ROM. You can buy the LDOCE5 at Amazon.co.uk for about $40.\n\nLDOCE5 Viewer costs only $5.35. Watch the video below to see how it works.\n\n&gt; Video &amp; Screenshots:| http://hakidame.net/ldoce5viewer/screenshots.html\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Amazing speed Ã¢â‚¬â€ LDOCE5 Viewer starts up in less than 3 seconds, even on old computers. (The original Longman app can take 17 seconds on a dual-core laptop with a standard hard drive.) Searches happen instantly.\n\n* Find what you want Ã¢â‚¬â€ instantly. Just start typing and you will immediately see a very complete list of search results, including inflected forms, collocations, idioms, phrasal verbs, Activator entries, etc. Ã¢â‚¬â€ even if you type an incomplete phrase. LDOCE5 Viewer is much better at finding what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for than the original LDOCE software.\n\n* Pleasant to use Ã¢â‚¬â€ No more clicking around to do what you want. To search, just start typing a word at any time. Press Enter to show the first search result. Use the down arrow key to display further results. And, of course, things like scrolling, copying and window work as expected.\n\n* Clean and readable. No visual distractions that take up valuable space. Entries are set in a very readable font.\n\n* Full sound playback Ã¢â‚¬â€ including word pronunciations, example sentences and sound effects.\n\n* Access virtually all of the LDOCE content, including the dictionary, collocations, thesaurus, corpus examples, Activator, pictures and grammar notes.\n\n* Powerful advanced search Ã¢â‚¬â€ You can specify a difficulty level, part of speech, subject, etc. You can combine multiple criteria (e.g. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most frequent spoken words 1000Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ AND Ã¢â‚¬Å“adjectiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Great for teachers who want to generate a list of the most common uncountable nouns, most common informal words, most common American words, words related to business, food, technology, etc.\n\n\n\nHow to Install\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### STEP 1: Installing LDOCE5\n\nIf you've already installed &quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 5th Edition (LDOCE5)&quot; with the Full install option, you can skip this step.\n\nIf you've installed LDOCE5 with another type of install (&quot;Minimal&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Recommended&quot;), you have to reinstall it.\n\nIf LDOCE5 hasn't been installed yet, you first have to install it. You MUST select &quot;Full&quot; when the LDOCE5 installer asks you to select the type of install. \n\n&gt; Screenshot: http://bayimg.com/GAHHOaAEj\n\n\n### STEP 2: Installing LDOCE5 Viewer\n\nRun ldoce5viewer-setup.exe to start the installer.\nFollow the instructions on the installer window.\n\n\n\n### STEP 3: Making Index files\n\nBy default, the installer will automatically start Ã¢â‚¬Å“LDOCE5 ViewerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when the installation complete. Otherwise, you have to launch it manually ([Start Menu] Ã¢â€ â€™ [All Programs] Ã¢â€ â€™ [LDOCE5 Viewer] Ã¢â€ â€™ [LDOCE5 Viewer]).\n\nWhen you run the LDOCE5 Viewer for the first time, it will ask you to start making some index files. (These files are used for searching)\nClick &quot;Yes&quot; to start indexing.\nThis process will take some time (It typically takes 3-10 minutes, depending on the speed of your machine). Please wait a while.\nDone!\n\nOnce the index files have been generated successfully, you can start using the application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d15954c4866d06bdd3eaf4716b19b54d47fe8d2a","amp;dn":"LDOCE5+Viewer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d15954c4866d06bdd3eaf4716b19b54d47fe8d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,89,84,196,134,109,6,189,211,234,244,113,107,25,181,77,71,254,141,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
