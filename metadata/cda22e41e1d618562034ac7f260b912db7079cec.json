Only seven of the richest 100 tech billionaires are women.\n\nAlice Levine is outraged! So she's pushing East End Ellie, ditzy art student Daisy, science boffin Neelam, fashion grad Tolani and wannabe millionaire Arooj into the testosterone-fuelled worth of tech.\n\nIn episode one, to prove the world of tech isn't just pizza-munching teenage boys and male masters of the machine universe, our girls take a whirl around London's silicon roundabout in the company of the most powerful women in tech. Fashion, gaming, apps - and digital slap! - the girls learn that making millions in the digital world isn't just about learning ones and zeroes, it's following your passion. And the cash will follow.\n\nBut are they up to the challenge of inventing a start-up from scratch in just five days? It's an emotional ride... and it's not just the code that'll crack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda22e41e1d618562034ac7f260b912db7079cec","amp;dn":"Girls.Can.Code.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda22e41e1d618562034ac7f260b912db7079cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,162,46,65,225,214,24,86,32,52,172,127,38,11,145,45,183,7,156,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
