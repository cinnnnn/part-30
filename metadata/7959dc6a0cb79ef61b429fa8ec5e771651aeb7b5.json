The EP quickly shipped Gold in sales, and a year later, had been certified Platinum, with both certifications being a first for a Hip hop EP. It featured a remix of &quot;Endangered Species&quot;, featuring a brand new verse from Public Enemy's Chuck D. Kill at Will is considered by Ice Cube fans to be among his best works, and original vinyl pressings are still highly sought after. The album has sold 704,382 copies to date according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nTrack listing[edit]\nNo.\tTitle\tProducer(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Endangered Species (Tales from the Darkside)&quot; (Remix) (featuring Chuck D)\tSir Jinx\t4:11\n2.\t&quot;Jackin' for Beats&quot;  \tChilly Chill\t2:57\n3.\t&quot;Get off My Dick and Tell Yo Bitch to Come Here (Remix)&quot;  \tSir Jinx\t3:38\n4.\t&quot;The Product&quot;  \tSir Jinx\t3:35\n5.\t&quot;Dead Homiez&quot;  \tIce Cube\t3:55\n6.\t&quot;JDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GaffilinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Part II)&quot;  \t \t0:36\n7.\t&quot;I Gotta Say What Up!!!&quot;  \tSir Jinx\t3:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7959dc6a0cb79ef61b429fa8ec5e771651aeb7b5","amp;dn":"Ice+Cube+-+Kill+at+Will+%281990%29+-+%28CDrip%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7959dc6a0cb79ef61b429fa8ec5e771651aeb7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,89,220,106,12,183,158,246,27,66,159,168,236,94,119,22,81,174,183,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
