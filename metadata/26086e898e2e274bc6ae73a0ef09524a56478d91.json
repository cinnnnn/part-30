It was very grainy, with lots of blockiness &amp; interlacing. I have tried to tidy it up (there is only so much you can do!), but there is still some residual interlacing. At least it is watchable now!\n\nThis is the first series, first aired in 1975.\n\nIt features Tony Selby and shows some of the early talents of Brian Pettifer (Rab C Nesbitt), Robert Lindsay (we all know who he is!), David Janson ('Allo 'Allo &amp; Keeping Up Appearances) as well as other well known actors.\n\nJust sit back and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26086e898e2e274bc6ae73a0ef09524a56478d91","amp;dn":"Get+Some+In+%28Series+1%29+%28mkv%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26086e898e2e274bc6ae73a0ef09524a56478d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,8,110,137,142,46,39,75,198,174,115,160,239,9,82,74,86,71,141,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
