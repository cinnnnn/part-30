Soon, Christmas will come to the world. And what to our wondering eyes should appear: but Santa's sleigh and his lively rein...dogs?!\n\nNarrated by James Earl Jones and featuring songs by Grammy Award winner Gary Morris, &quot;Nine Dog Christmas&quot; is the delightful animated tale of nine homeless canines who take the place of flu-stricken reindeer. Lead elf Buzz (Scott Hamilton) must give them flying lessons. And somehow the dogs must escape back to the North Pole after a troublemaker kidnaps them. But Snowplow, Tank, QT and the rest succeed. And little do they expect that the list Santa has checked twice includes a sweet surprise for them.\n\nProduct Description\n\nJust two days before Christmas, Santa's reindeer come down with the notorious North Pole flu and are unable to fly Santa's sleigh. In hopes of finding replacements, Buzz, the head elf, makes a trip to New York and stumbles upon a ragtag traveling circus of misfit dogs that he takes back to the North Pole for flight training. On Christmas Eve, the dog's greedy owner steals the dogs back leaving Santa grounded. With the help of his quick-witted protege, Buzz returns the dogs in time to help Santa bring Christmas to the children of the world.
