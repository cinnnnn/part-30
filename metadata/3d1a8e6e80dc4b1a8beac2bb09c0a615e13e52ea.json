An alien race has begun colonising Earth by taking over human bodies and erasing their minds and memories and only a small band of survivors remain who are working to protect themselves from extinction. One of them is Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan), who, when out on a search for food, meets another human being named Jared Howe (Max Irons) and it isn't long before they begin to develop feelings for one another. However, when Melanie is taken by the alien species and is made host to one of their own, it seems all hope is lost. That is, until Melanie's mind begins to fight back against her new inhabitor and her human emotions and memories ignite some empathy in the alien parasite.\n\n\nCast: Saoirse Ronan, Diane Kruger, William Hurt, Max Irons, Jake Abel, Frances Fisher, Boyd Holbrook, Chandler Canterbury, Andrea Frankle, Scott Lawrence, Tatanka Means\nDirector: Andrew Niccol\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517260/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517260/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Rating: 5.7\n\n\nGeneral Info:\nRelease Title: The Host (2013) 1080p MKV x264 DTS BDRip [Pioneer]\nGenre:  Action | Sci-Fi | Romance\nRelease Date: 29 March 2013\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English | Spanish | French\nTotal Size: 5.11 GiB\nDuration: 2h 5mn\nOverall Bit rate: 5826 Kbps\nSource: Blu-Ray\n\n\nVideo Specs:\nContainer and Codec: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nFormat: MKV\nBit rate: 4201 Kbps\nResolution: 1920 x 800\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n\nAudio Specs:\nAudio Codec And Type: DTS\nBitrate: 1509 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/470/vjl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/470/vjl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/861/1hts.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/861/1hts.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img407/4800/1t9j.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img407/4800/1t9j.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/1406/o4m8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/1406/o4m8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/4396/vwtm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/4396/vwtm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img812/2759/0ju1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img812/2759/0ju1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1a8e6e80dc4b1a8beac2bb09c0a615e13e52ea","amp;dn":"The+Host+%282013%29+1080p+MKV+x264+DTS+BDRip+%5BPioneer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1a8e6e80dc4b1a8beac2bb09c0a615e13e52ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,26,142,110,128,220,75,26,139,234,194,187,9,192,166,21,225,62,82,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
