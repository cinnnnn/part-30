This military standard is approved for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense.\n\n2. Beneficial comments (recommendations, additions, deletions) and any pertinent data which may be of use in improving this document should be addressed to: ASC/ENSI, 2530 Loop Road West, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433-7101, by using the self-addressed Standardization Document Improvement Proposal (DD Form 1426) appearing at the end of this document or by letter.\n\n3. The test requirements previously contained in MIL-STD-462 used to verify compliance with MIL-STD-461 have been included in this version of MIL-STD 461.\n\n4. The stated interface requirements are considered necessary to provide reasonable confidence that a particular subsystem or equipment complying with these requirements will function within their designated design tolerances when operating in their intended electromagnetic environment (EME). The procuring activity should consider tailoring the individual requirements to be more or less severe based on the design features of the intended platform and its mission in concert with personnel knowledgeable about electromagnetic compatibility issues affecting platform integration.\n\n5. An appendix is included which provides the rationale and background for each requirement and verification section.\n\n6. A committee consisting of representatives of the Army, Air Force, Navy, other DoD agencies, and Industry prepared this document.
