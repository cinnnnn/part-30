And many of the 23 cuts on Behind Closed Doors are firmly within the Southern soul tradition â€“ slow, smoky, gritty, and soulful, anchored by languid stride piano and buttressed by muscular horns.\r\n\r\nMost of the sides slide by at a slow tempo, rhythms that usually groove to a deep funk and occasionally are given a sweet, smooth soul veneer (the Limelites' &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot;) but often the proceedings are stately, the better to showcase the singer (Percy Sledge's &quot;Take Time to Know Her,&quot; Tony Borders' &quot;Gentle On My Mind,&quot; Solomon Burke's &quot;He'll Have to Go,&quot; Brook Benton's &quot;She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye&quot;). \r\n\r\nAll this slowness means that the cuts that do pick up the tempo really stand out from the pack: Cookie Jackson's take on Tammy Wynette's &quot;Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad&quot; blazes, and Moses &amp; Joshua Dillard's ebullient rendition of Wynette &amp; David Houston's &quot;My Elusive Dreams&quot; is positively addictive. But even if there's not a whole lot of variety here, there are plenty of good cuts that capture country-soul at its best.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Aaron Neville - The Grand Tour\r\n02 - Solomon Burke - He'll Have To Go\r\n03 - Percy Sledge - Take Time To Know Her\r\n04 - Esther Phillips - I Saw Me\r\n05 - Moses And Joshua Dillard - My Elusive Dreams\r\n06 - Ann Peebles - Hangin' On\r\n07 - Bobby Sheen - My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You\r\n08 - Tami Lynn - Wings Upon Your Horns\r\n09 - The Limelites - Before The Next Teardrop Falls\r\n10 - Al Green - I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\r\n11 - James Carr - Life Turned Her That Way\r\n12 - Candi Staton - He Called Me Baby\r\n13 - Z.Z Hill - The Chokin' Kind\r\n14 - Joe Simon - Yours, Love\r\n15 - Cookie Jackson - Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad\r\n16 - Arthur Alexander - Detroit City\r\n17 - Tony Borders - Gentle On My Mind\r\n18 - Bettye Swann - Don't Touch Me\r\n19 - Clarence Carter - Set Me Free\r\n20 - Little Milton - Behind Closed Doors\r\n21 - Millie Jackson - If You're Not Back In Love By Monday\r\n22 - Joe Tex - Skip A Rope\r\n23 - Brook Benton - She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\r\n\r\n*2012 Ace Records / Kent Records | CDKEND 375\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9b714ed36ab8ecee959c217ac51a4a831057bc","amp;dn":"VA+-+Behind+Closed+Doors%3A+Where+Country+Meets+Soul+Vol.+1+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9b714ed36ab8ecee959c217ac51a4a831057bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,155,113,78,211,106,184,236,238,149,156,33,122,197,26,74,131,16,87,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
