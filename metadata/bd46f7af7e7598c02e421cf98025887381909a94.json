I mean it&amp;#039;s not rocket science. You can&amp;#039;t find any of the 3 Boxer albums listed below on CD unless you are prepared to pay collector&amp;#039;s prices of around Ã‚Â£40 or more. Ok, so these were not big sellers at the time of release but they still deserve a listen because they were great.\n\nWhat I have uploaded here is somebody else&amp;#039;s vinyl rip which I obtained some time ago. I have cleaned it up with some sympathetic edits and the results are not bad (bearing in mind I almost deleted the original upload for not being up to standard - I&amp;#039;m glad I didn&amp;#039;t now!)\n\nIf any kind soul out there in torrent land has good CD copies of the three Boxer albums then do us all a favour and share them please.\n\nBOXER INFO: borrowed from the internet\n\nNotable for their inclusion of Mike Patto and Ollie Halsall. Boxer had an album withdrawn in 1976 &quot;Bloodletting&quot; (Virgin V 2073), 1976, and consequently it has become a sought-after item. Mike Patto played with Centipede, Bo Street Runners, Chicago Blues Line, Timebox, Spooky Tooth and Patto. Ollie Halsall played with Kevin Ayers, Grimms, Rhythm and Blues Inc., Tempest, Patto and Timebox. Keith Ellis played with Juicy Lucy, Spooky Tooth and Van der Graaf Generator. Tony Newman was with Sounds Incorporated, Jeff Beck, May Blitz, David Bowie, T.Rex, Three Man Army and Driftwood.\n\n\nBoxer&amp;#039;s album, &quot;Below The Belt&quot;, ran into censorship problems as the cover had a picture of a naked lady with a strategically placed boxing glove, the reverse had no such glove! The album had its moments musically as all albums featuring Patto and Halsall do. Both are sadly no longer with us.\n\nTaken from The Tapestry of Delights - The Comprehensive Guide to British Music of the Beat, R&amp;B, Psychedelic and Progressive Eras 1963-1976, Vernon Joynson\nISBN 1 899855 04 1 \n\n\n\nPersonnel:\nKeith Ellis - Bass\nOllie Halsall - Guitar, Keyboards\nTony Newman - Drums\nMike Patto - Vocals, Keyboards\nChris Stainton - Keyboards \n\nAlbums:\nBelow The Belt (Virgin V 2049) 1975 (reissued on CD: Virgin CDV2049, 1997)\nBloodletting (Virgin V 2073) 1976 (reissued on CD: Virgin CDV2073, 1997)\nAbsolutely (CBS/Epic AL 34812) 1977\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd46f7af7e7598c02e421cf98025887381909a94","amp;dn":"Boxer+-+Below+the+Belt+%5B1976%5D+Vinyl+Remastered+%5BPATTO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd46f7af7e7598c02e421cf98025887381909a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,70,247,175,126,117,152,192,46,66,28,249,128,37,136,115,129,144,154,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
