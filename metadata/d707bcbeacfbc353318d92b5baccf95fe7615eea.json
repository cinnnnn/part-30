RAMALLAH is a horrifying window into the sheer depravity and brutality that has resulted from the mantra of an eye for an eye and the credo of &quot;do unto others as they have done unto you&quot;. RAMALLAH seeks to expose the ugliness of the bloodshed we get a sneak peak of in the evening news. Rob explains, &quot;We live in terrible times. People should be terrified and horrified and disgusted at what's going on in this world and in their name every single day. Ramallah is here to shove it all right down their throats.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d707bcbeacfbc353318d92b5baccf95fe7615eea","amp;dn":"Ramallah-But+A+Whimper+2005+Re-Issue+..240kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d707bcbeacfbc353318d92b5baccf95fe7615eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,7,188,190,172,251,195,83,49,141,146,181,186,204,249,95,231,97,94,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
