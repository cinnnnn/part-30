Combining traditional fiddle tunes with modern compositions, and sometimes blending the two by adding new lyrics to old melodies or coming up with new and unusual musical juxtapositions (the shape-note song &quot;Buonaparte&quot; segues seamlessly into the music hall song &quot;Bony on the Isle of St. Helena,&quot; for example), Uncle Earl pays homage to the past without either groveling to it or arrogantly &quot;updating&quot; it. Throughout the program, the gentle lilt of their singing voices contrasts beautifully with the full-blooded energy of their playing -- note, in particular, the sprightly and gorgeous &quot;Wish I Had My Time Again&quot; and the Cajun 2-step arrangement of Bob Dylan's &quot;Wallflower.&quot; And a healthy streak of humor runs throughout as well, as exemplified by the Chinese commentary running over the top of the old Seven Foot Dilly tune &quot;Streak O'Lean, Streak O'Fat&quot; and by the wryly regretful original composition &quot;D&amp;P Blues.&quot; If they can keep this up, we all may wake up one morning to find that Uncle Earl is America's finest roots band....\n\n\nclickable Dick\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e64ec024a7f11f0a38dedfa4a339f4a6f041e9","amp;dn":"Uncle+Earl+-+Waterloo%2C+Tennessee+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e64ec024a7f11f0a38dedfa4a339f4a6f041e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,230,78,192,36,167,241,31,10,56,222,223,164,163,57,244,166,240,65,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
