Citizen Hughes is the New York Times bestselling exposÃƒÂ© of HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden life, and a stunning revelation of his Ã¢â‚¬Å“megalomaniac empire in the emperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own wordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Newsweek). \nAt the height of his wealth, power, and invisibility, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richest and most secretive man kept what amounted to a diary. The billionaire commanded his empire by correspondence, scrawling thousands of handwritten memos to unseen henchmen. It was the only time Howard Hughes risked writing down his orders, plans, thoughts, fears, and desires. Hughes claimed the papers were so sensitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“the very most confidential, almost sacred information as to my innermost activitiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€that not even his most trusted aides or executives were allowed to keep the messages he sent them. But in the early-morning hours of June 5, 1974, unknown burglars staged a daring break-in at HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposedly impregnable headquarters and escaped with all the confidential files. Despite a top-secret FBI investigation and a million-dollar CIA buyback bid, none of the stolen secret papers were ever foundÃ¢â‚¬â€until investigative reporter Michael Drosnin cracked the case. \nIn Citizen Hughes, Drosnin reveals the true story of the great Hughes heistÃ¢â‚¬â€and of the real Howard Hughes. Based on nearly ten thousand never-before-published documents, more than three thousand in HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own handwriting, Citizen Hughes is far more than a biography, or even an unwilling autobiography. It is a startling record of the secret history of our times.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2cd833fa56e37f42461dfc14d173aa4c1d6930e","amp;dn":"Citizen+Hughes+Power%2C+Money+by+Michael+Drosnin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2cd833fa56e37f42461dfc14d173aa4c1d6930e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,205,131,63,165,110,55,244,36,97,223,193,77,23,58,164,193,214,147,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
