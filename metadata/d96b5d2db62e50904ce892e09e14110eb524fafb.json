The FC70 emulates the legendary smooth, effortless dynamic control and uniquely musical character of the classic Fairchild 670 limiter.\nModelled using measured data and schematics from genuine hardware, the FC70 uses a fully balanced design, combined with innovative delay-free feedback topology to emulate the original circuitry. The sidechain includes the fast attack and program dependent release settings of the original, combined with Lateral / Vertical, Independent and Linked stereo channel modes.\n\nPTC-2A\nFirst developed for linux audio workstations, the FC70 is now available as a Windows / Mac VST and Mac Audio Unit.

The PTH-2A uses the same filter emulation technology, providing separately adjustable LF Boost and Attenuate controls for the signature Pultec low-end sound, with three selectable frequencies.\n\n\nAudio Unit\nOverToneDYN500\nOverToneEQ500\nOverToneFC70\nOverTonePTC2A\nOverTonePTH2A\n\nVST\nDYN500-VST\nEQ500-VST\nFC70-VST\nPTC-2A-VST\n\nBETA Mavericks (AU Only)\nOverToneDYN500\nOverToneEQ500\nOverToneFC70\nOverTonePTC2A\nOverTonePTH2A\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.Install software.\n2.Run Keygen.exe with KeyGen APP OS X\n   (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9369486) or_ Windows to generate keyfile,\n  or use pre generated key file instead.\n3.Register Plugins.\n4.Enjoy!\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96b5d2db62e50904ce892e09e14110eb524fafb","amp;dn":"OverToneDSP+-+Plugins+Pack+v2.0.0+-+OS+X+-+R2R+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96b5d2db62e50904ce892e09e14110eb524fafb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,107,93,45,182,46,80,144,76,232,146,224,158,20,17,14,181,36,250,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
