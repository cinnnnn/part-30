It contained the #1 hit, &quot;(Can&amp;#039;t Live Without Your) Love and Affection&quot; and the follow-up single, &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which reached #6.\n\nNelson is a glam metal band founded by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson (the twin sons of Ricky Nelson.) They had a No. 1 hit in the United States with &quot;(Can&amp;#039;t Live Without Your) Love and Affection&quot; during the week of September 29, 1990. They are listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only family to reach number one record status in three successive generations (beginning with grandparents Ozzie and Harriet Nelson). On the other side of their family, their great-grandfather was World War II-era Navy Secretary Frank Knox.\n\nThe band split with Geffen Records record label after 1995, but they have continued to produce and release albums independently under their label, Stone Canyon Records. However, they have yet to revisit the level of success they experienced during their 1990 debut.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ad66e572619935ea02a91cc27bb890e93f9259","amp;dn":"Nelson+-+After+The+Rain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73ad66e572619935ea02a91cc27bb890e93f9259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,173,102,229,114,97,153,53,234,2,169,28,194,123,184,144,233,63,146,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
