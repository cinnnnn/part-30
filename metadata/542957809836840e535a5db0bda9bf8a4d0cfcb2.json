It was their first recording to chart, and appeared almost two years before their first single to do so in the corresponding UK Singles Chart - &quot;Sneakin' Suspicion&quot; (June 1977)\n\nMalpractice saw Dr. Feelgood break into the UK Top 20, the success of the release a gauge of a change in the musical climate. With their drainpipe suits, short hair, and surly demeanour, they were as influential as any at the inception of punk rock.\n\nThe album was re-issued in August 1990 on the Grand Records label in both vinyl and CD formats.\nTrack listing\n1.&quot;I Can Tell&quot; (Ellas McDaniel, Samuel F.
