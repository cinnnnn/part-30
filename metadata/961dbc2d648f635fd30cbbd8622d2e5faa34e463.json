During each episode, the unsuspecting &quot;marks&quot; will think they are the stars of a new game show or reality show, or that they are auditioning for a big Hollywood movie or television role. What they don't realize is, they ARE the stars, but in the most unexpected and entertaining way, in front of millions of people on TV. Sometimes as himself, other times incognito, Howie and his crew, including his very own son Alex, and &quot;man on the street&quot; Vic will venture anywhere -- from the great outdoors, to a night club, or to the set of a talk show -- to play out a hoax the likes of which viewers have never seen before. These are 15-minutes of fame some people can do without, and with Howie in disguise, you never know what will happen next!\n\n\n\nThe gags in this show have been described as hit or miss, the one's that aren't as funny seem to drag on but the ones that are funny make it worth it. \nRipped from hulu.com; why? because hulu's plan is to post these for free to prevent piracy #who wants to waste time downloading what they can get for free#. Then they plan to remove episodes when the dvd sale is available, if theres a torrent to back it up, it remains free forever.\nThis rips slightly improved from its Predecessors.\n\n\n\n\nName: howie-do-it-episode-6.avi\n\nLength: 21:12.551\nFramerate: 29.976 fps\nResolution: 480x368 \nVideocodec: XviD \nVideobitrate: 1663 kbps\nAudio: MP3, 2 chnl#s#, 217 kbps VBR, 44100 Hz\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:961dbc2d648f635fd30cbbd8622d2e5faa34e463","amp;dn":"Howie+Do+It+S01E06+hulu_rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"961dbc2d648f635fd30cbbd8622d2e5faa34e463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,29,188,45,100,143,99,95,211,12,187,216,98,45,46,95,170,52,228,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
