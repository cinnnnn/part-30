These narratives dazzle on the surface with beautifully rendered settings and vistas, and dig deep psychologically. At every turn, Mary Gordon reveals in her charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interactions those crucial flashes of understanding that change lives forever. So richly developed itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe they fit into novella-size packages, these tales carry us away both as individual stories and as a larger experience of GordonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary mastery and human sympathy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80db4084a2200e8ef29f4ee6726a40efff72fe98","amp;dn":"Mary+Gordon+-+The+Liar%27s+Wife+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80db4084a2200e8ef29f4ee6726a40efff72fe98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,219,64,132,162,32,14,142,242,159,78,230,114,106,64,239,255,114,254,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
