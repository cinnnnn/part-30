They seems to respect each other, but not their different approaches to the mathematics involved.\nThis book is about what parallel means in terms of tensors and functions inside a spherical manifold.\nMore interesting than the context is the subtext of two of the most important men of the 20th century exchanging nearly polite letters like this and having them collected and published","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab0c0e4f774232dc2e73bf34df4718c6fdad69d","amp;dn":"+Letters+on+absolute+parallelism+%281929-1932%29+Robert+Devever%2C+Eli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab0c0e4f774232dc2e73bf34df4718c6fdad69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,176,192,228,247,116,35,45,194,231,59,243,77,244,113,140,111,218,214,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
