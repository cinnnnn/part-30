But when she doesnt make it after auditioning, she learns that it takes more than precision and perfection to succeed in the dance world. With a turn in a cutting-edge hip-hop club and the help of a good-looking former hockey player, she may just find the passion she needs to make her dreams come true. Peter Gallagher (TVs The O.C.) and a cast of hot up-and-coming stars including newcomers Rachele Smith and Kenny Wormald rock to a new beat in this unmissable sensation!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2e3e6ed95d0f84c42b0073d1143fc5adf377e7","amp;dn":"Centre+Stage+-+Turn+It+Up+2008+DVDrip+H264+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2e3e6ed95d0f84c42b0073d1143fc5adf377e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,46,62,110,217,93,15,132,196,43,0,115,209,20,63,197,173,243,119,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
