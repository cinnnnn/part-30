Having never played one before, he instantly shaped the direction\nand feel of this performance out of this spontaneous decision to have a go at\nit. The three musicians joining SandellÃ¢â‚¬â€trumpeter Magnus Broo, bassist Johan\nBerthling and drummer Paal Nilssen-LoveÃ¢â‚¬â€have all collaborated on various\nprojects in the past. This combination might be the first, hopefully, of many\nfor The Godforgottens.\n\nThe three lengthy tracksÃ¢â‚¬â€between ten and twenty minutesÃ¢â‚¬â€crystallize from the B3,\nbut not as the work of an American jazz/blues organ band. The sound might best\nbe described as the imaginary meeting of Sun Ra and Miles Davis, circa\n1974. The opening &quot;Always Forgotten,&quot; begins with a placid organ wash,\nproviding an equable current of energy under the unwrinkled tone of Broo's\ntrumpet. With the entrance of Berthling's bowed bass and Nilssen-Love's\npercussion wash, The Godforgottens create a soundscape in which some very\nintimate improvisations can be built...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b0cc2e92e46a2d882468b33a6a69f6372f1bc67","amp;dn":"The+Godforgottens+-+Never+Forgotten%2C+Always+Remembered+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b0cc2e92e46a2d882468b33a6a69f6372f1bc67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,12,194,233,46,70,162,216,130,70,139,51,166,166,159,99,114,241,188,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
