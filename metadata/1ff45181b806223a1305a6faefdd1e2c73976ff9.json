The rate dependence is crucial in the description. The implementation of discussed phenomenological physical laws into the environment of numerical codes is in focus of presentation. Numerical examples prove the importance of using the new constitutive properties in design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff45181b806223a1305a6faefdd1e2c73976ff9","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Constitutive+Relations+Applied+in+Computer+Codes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff45181b806223a1305a6faefdd1e2c73976ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,244,81,129,184,6,34,58,19,5,166,250,239,221,30,44,115,151,111,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
