But Khariton's simple lifestyle belies his unbelievable past, and the part he played in the nuclear arms race - a vast and complex web of intrigue that was the crux of the Cold War. For over thirty years, he was one of the leading figures in the Soviet nuclear weapons programme; even now, he still travels in his own private train carriage, complete with personal housekeeper - a privilege shared by few other nonagenarians.\nIn Soviet Russia, scientific research allowed no margin for error: if the survival of the communist regime depended on the success of the bomb project, so too did the lives of its researchers. Asked what would happen in the event of failure, Stalin replied: &quot;Shoot the scientists.&quot; But though the USA poured the equivalent of 20-30 billion roubles into the creation of the bomb, the USSR achieved the same result at much less expense - largely thanks to its intelligence network that spanned all the world's research hotspots, from the university of Cambridge to the deserts of New Mexico.\nProgress on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain was top secret: the wider world relied on whispers, and the occasional shockwave reaching Washington from test sites in the remote Kazakh steppe. While America was broadcasting its nuclear prowess in triumphant newsreels, few in the West suspected how close Russia was to retaliation.\nWith Khariton as senior scientific consultant, filmmaker Jamie Doran gains unprecedented access to a cast of fascinating characters, including pilots and Red Guards, eminent physicsts and NKVD spies. Filmed in the early 1990s, and deftly interweaving archive footage and eyewitness accounts, The Red Bomb is itself a snapshot of a unique moment in history, as a Russia on its way out of Stalin's shadow offers a glimpse of its arsenal of Cold War secrets.\nExecutive Producers for Discovery : Tomi Bednar Landis &amp; Nancy LeBrun\nProduced and Directed by Jamie Doran\nA Rapide Production for Discovery Communications 1994\n\n\n\n2)  End of Innocence \nA more detailed investigation of Russia's nuclear coming-of-age, this episode traces the atom bomb back to its infancy - to a time when state-sponsored Russian physicists were sent to Cambridge in pursuit of an obscure new technology. But the Bolshevik government was slow to catch on to the strategic importance of atomic energy, continually dismissing it in favour of good old traditional weapons.\nThe Americans had Einstein, Niels Bohr and a state-of-the-art testing base in New Mexico. Meanwhile, the Russians had a &quot;tiny cluttered laboratory&quot; in central Moscow (later upgraded to a tent in a muddy field) and no uranium to speak of. Told by the men who were involved, this is a tale of success against the odds, achieved thanks to an eccentric yet dedicated network of scientists and spies (including a bicycling femme fatale nicknamed &quot;Red Sonya&quot;), and the fatal negligence of MI5.\nEthical scruples were continually shelved - America's bomb-building project was validated in the name of beating Hitler, while Russia justified its atom spies by claiming the right to information that its allies should have shared. In 1945, Niels Bohr tried to persuade the Americans that to drop the bomb would be to open a Pandora's Box of horrors. He urged Roosevelt to collaborate with Stalin on the bomb - but the President refused to listen. With post-Cold-War hindsight, Bohr's futile efforts appear as the doomed actions of a tragic hero.\nThe film is powered by priceless testimonies from Yuly Khariton, &quot;Red Sonya&quot;, Ilya Starinov and Anatoly Yakovlev, to name but a few (somebody seems to have gone through Stalin's address book). Also includes a rare archive interview with the famously taciturn Klaus Fuchs, the mole who infiltrated the American laboratories.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/4762/u581.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/4762/u581.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7091/d125.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7091/d125.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7572/cegx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/7572/cegx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7735/6fon.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7735/6fon.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2015/98cw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2015/98cw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1695/t3am.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1695/t3am.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2410/k2qv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/2410/k2qv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/3626/vrxc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/3626/vrxc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8727/rd5m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/8727/rd5m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/7439/cy8a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/7439/cy8a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/662/y4jx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/662/y4jx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/847/z09m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/847/z09m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4094/w0dl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4094/w0dl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8263/y5mj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8263/y5mj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/7561/3g74.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/7561/3g74.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2742/iwof.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2742/iwof.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1744 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x536\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.343:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:53.000\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 700 MB (average)\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37736098044f488a0e65d02ae3dd56699500ef72","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+The+Red+Bomb+2of3+End+of+Innocence+XviD+AC3+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37736098044f488a0e65d02ae3dd56699500ef72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,115,96,152,4,79,72,138,14,101,208,42,227,221,86,105,149,0,239,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
