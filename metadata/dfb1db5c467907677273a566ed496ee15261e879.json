And complicating matters further, Georgie Caruso's thugs attack Luanne's studio. Meanwhile, Clay comes to an agreement with Elliott Oswald (Patrick St. Esprit); and Chibs' estranged wife shows up at his hospital bedside. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb1db5c467907677273a566ed496ee15261e879","amp;dn":"Sons.of.Anarchy.S02E08.720p.HDTV.x264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb1db5c467907677273a566ed496ee15261e879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,177,219,92,70,121,7,103,114,115,165,102,237,73,110,225,82,97,232,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
