The film is based on the novella of the same title by Elizabeth McNeill.The film was not a major success commercially in the United States, grossing USD $7 million in box office receipts alone, and was very badly received by critics. Despite its moderate success in North America, the film acquired a large fanbase on video and was a huge success internationally.[citation needed] The film is now well known for its erotic sadomasochistic content.The film spawned two direct-to-video sequels, Another 9Ã‚Â½ Weeks in 1997 and The First 9Ã‚Â½ Weeks in 1998.\n\nThe title of the film refers to the duration of a sadomasochistic relationship between Wall Street investor John Grey (played by Mickey Rourke) and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw (Kim Basinger). The two meet while in New York City and lead a (sometimes violent) sex life.They often try out a variety of diverse sexual and erotic acts, including a scene in which John teases her body with ice while she&amp;#039;s blindfolded; a scene in which John spoon feeds Elizabeth various kinds of foods while her eyes are closed; a scene in which Elizabeth takes off a tuxedo and has sex with her partner in a rainy brick alley stairway; and Basinger&amp;#039;s now iconic striptease to Randy Newman&amp;#039;s &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On,&quot; as performed by Joe Cocker.The film details a sexual downward spiral as John pushes Elizabeth&amp;#039;s boundaries toward her eventual emotional breakdown. He often manipulates her into getting what he wants during sex and sometimes abuses her, knowing she cannot resist it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091635/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091635/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Adrian Lyne \nProduced by Mark Damon\nSidney Kimmel\nZalman King \nWritten by Sarah Kernochan\nZalman King \nStarring Kim Basinger\nMickey Rourke \n\nRelease date(s) February 21, 1986 \nRunning time 112 min.\n\nLength.......................: 112 min\nDisc 1.......................: 583MB\nDisc 2.......................: 655MB\n\nOrig.
