This triple disc set includes all four of their albums plus bonus tracks. 45 tracks total. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs it possible for a band to be too good? Is it possible for a band to be too ahead of its time, too talented, too ecclectic, too innovative, too brilliant? Sadly, the answer is yes.\nI have been swimming through the beautiful depths of 60's music for years. My all-time favorite band is of course LOVE. I adore the famous bands like the Byrds, Doors, Kinks, Beatles, Country Joe, Donovan, etc. as well as the lesser knowns like The Moon, the Brigade, Pearls Before Swine, Terry Reid, etc.. -- but until I found this 3-disc set of Kaleidescope (USA), I honestly didn't think there were anymore TRULY great bands from the 60's that I didn't know.\nThese guys were incredible. One minute sounding like the Seeds, the next like the Byrds, and then all of a sudden -- sounding totally unique and un-classifiable. Some songs are dreamy folk-psych (&quot;Keep Your Mind Open&quot;) and the next you're listening to Middle-Eastern journeys, and then back to solid '60s pop, and then suddenly into rag-time country music. All over the map. All over the place. Vocals are outstanding. Lyrics incredible. And the musical innovations just don't stop. How is it possible that this band has been so over-looked for so long? Too genius...?\n\n[Amazon user]\n\nEvangeline Recorded Works, Ltd has just released Pulsating Dream - the Epic Recordings, a 3CD set that includes all four of the albums Kaleidoscope recorded for Epic, along with the singles.
