An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings, however, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit, &quot;Move It&quot; (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock &amp; roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these, although it was by no means one of the more successful, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad &quot;Blue Turns to Grey&quot;).\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Dave Thompson):\n\nThe fourth volume in Disky's ambitious five-CD Cliff Richard anthology, 1980s might well be the weakest of them all. It is certainly the most unmemorable, as Richard succumbed to the same musical curse that benighted almost every other veteran superstar of the day. He let the producers call the shots. In terms of both success and self-determination, Richard was now untouchable, a part of the rock &amp; roll furniture, and absolutely independent from the hit singles and critical acclaim that once defined a viable artiste. So the decade saw him flit from seething rock &amp; roll revivals to mawkish Christmas ballads, from inspired duets to ill-informed power ballads, and while this collection does trim away the more unbearable (or maybe just overplayed) excesses, it is still a reminder of just how unpleasant mainstream music in the 1980s sounded, and how anonymous even the most individual superstars became. Those drumsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦those keyboardsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦those hairstyles. The 1980s were a conveyor belt of sickly sound-alikes, and Cliff Richard rode it as willingly as every one of his peers. Thank goodness it only lasted ten years.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:djfexqtkldfe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:djfexqtkldfe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000IA2Y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000IA2Y&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
