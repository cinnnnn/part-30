Manifesto by Valerie Solanas.doc\n\nConsidered in some corners to be alternately satire, brilliant, a sad commentary on a disturbed woman's inner psyche, or a treatise on what men reveal to sex workers, Valerie Solanas' 1968 pamphlet 'The S.C.U.M. Manifesto' stands as the singularly most reviled work of Feminist Literature to date.\n\nHad the genders been reversed, no doubt this would have been considered the work of a deeply disturbed and hateful man.  But Feminists insist that this work is a &quot;Literary Device&quot; to foment discussion and inspire intellectual self-discovery.\n\nShort, violent, disturbed and to the point, The S.C.U.M. Manifesto will leave its readers no doubt as to what the deepest held values of Feminism are.\n\nNot for the faint of heart.\n\nMGTOW, Men's Rights, mens rights, MRA, FRA, anti-feminism, feminism, mra, fra, Father's Rights, fathers rights, misandry, anti-misandry\n\nThe Essential Men's Rights Library - Torrent #10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4dfc8463b94491d62bba5cf852a7c6b98798cbc","amp;dn":"Sex+-+SCUM+Manifesto+by+Valerie+Solanas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4dfc8463b94491d62bba5cf852a7c6b98798cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,223,200,70,59,148,73,29,98,187,165,207,133,42,124,107,152,121,140,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
