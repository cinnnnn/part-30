At a tender age, she becomes convinced that she will never find true love, instead believing that &quot;love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer. . . .&quot; A chance meeting in Rio takes her to Geneva, where she dreams of finding fame and fortune. Maria's despairing view of love is put to the test when she meets a handsome young painter. In this odyssey of self-discovery, Maria has to choose between pursuing a path of darkness Ã¢â‚¬â€ sexual pleasure for its own sake Ã¢â‚¬â€ or risking everything to find her own &quot;inner light&quot; and the possibility of sacred sex, sex in the context of love.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfa9d37858a68dfdbfae63c6eabca7e4f2cc654","amp;dn":"Eleven+Minutes+by+Paul+Coelho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfa9d37858a68dfdbfae63c6eabca7e4f2cc654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,250,157,55,133,138,104,223,219,250,230,60,110,171,202,126,79,44,198,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
