A very limited vinyl only release from 1995. It is 1969-70 studio outtakes from Yuya Uchida &amp; The Flowers album &quot;Challenge&quot; before they became the Flower Travellin' Band.  From Pussies to Death in 10,000 Years of Freak Out! These were crazy sides recorded before the golden dawn of the Flower Travelling Band. Extreme suites of lead-molten guitar, poured with pain and beautiful psychedelic wonder into the mouth of the round eye cow.\r\n\r\nFROM PUSSIES TO DEATH IN 10,000 YEARS OF FREAKOUT (recorded '69-'70) released(1995)\r\n\r\n\r\ncombined 1'm dead into 1 track\r\nmp3 320kbps \r\nTracklist\r\nA/B1\tI'm Dead Part One/Part Two      :27.19\r\n\t \r\nB2\tOtoko                           :4.29  \t\r\nB3\tStone Free\t                :3.43\r\nB4\tHow Many More Times?            :6.56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7f42b0ee5412703f5f9efe9f38c308641f0239","amp;dn":"Flower+Travellin+Band+-+Pussies+to+death+10000+yr+freakout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7f42b0ee5412703f5f9efe9f38c308641f0239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,127,66,176,238,84,18,112,63,95,158,254,159,56,195,8,100,31,2,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
