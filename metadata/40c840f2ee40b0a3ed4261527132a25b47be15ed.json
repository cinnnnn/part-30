Born on April 2, 1781, in the small village of Chhapaiya in northern India, He displayed divine powers from childhood. By the age of 10, He had mastered the Hindu scriptures. At the age of 11, He renounced His home to embark on a 7 year journey on foot, across the length and breadth of India. By the age of 14, He mastered ashtang-yoga. Eventually, settling in Gujarat at the age of 18, He spent the remaining three decades of His life transforming the lives of countless people. He ushered in a moral and spiritual renaissance in Gujarat. Bhagwan Swaminarayan and His sadhus campaigned against and abolished the customs of widow burning, female infanticide and many other vices in society. In the Shikshapatri, He prescribed a moral code of conduct for His disciples, and through the Vachanamrut enlightened them with the essence of scriptural knowledge. Having redeemed humanity till 1830, Bhagwan Swaminarayan promised to remain ever-present on earth through a succession of God-realized gurus.\nToday, His Divine Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the fifth spiritual successor, is faithfully promoting the spiritual tradition of Bhagwan Swaminarayan.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ghanshyam and the Storm of EvilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the first part in a series of animations on Bhagwan SwaminarayanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and work.

We see how fish magically come to life when Ghanshyam takes pity on those caught in the fishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s net. The fisherman gets the fright of his life and promises to give up violence. Dharmadev sends Ghanshyam to tend the fields, where he miraculously sends the sparrows into a trance. Ghanshyam and his friends pick some delicious mangoes from the orchard and also teach greedy Ramdutt a lesson when he tries to take the mangoes away.
