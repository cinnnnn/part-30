We do it every week at this time. Once a week with American Top 40 and you know where your favorite songs are.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nTavares has their first chart single, &quot;Check It Out&quot; (at number 38).\n\nA listener writes in to correct AT40 concerning their statement that &quot;Monster Mash&quot; by Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett held the all-time record for forty weeks in the top 40. Casey has to confess it was only 37 weeks, and Johnny Mathis (with his song &quot;Wonderful, Wonderful&quot;) is still the record-holder at 39 weeks.\n\nBefore John Cougar, there was Millie Jackson with her song &quot;Hurts So Good&quot; (at number 27).\n\nMaybe you knew that Diana Ross's 1984 song &quot;Missing You&quot; was a tribute to Marvin Gaye who had died earlier that year, but did you know they recorded together? Their song &quot;You're A Special Part Of Me&quot; is at number 18.\n\nCasey tells how a musician in the countdown once played a practical joke on Elton John, and it was a pretty good one.\n\n40: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - Elton John\n39: Rocky Mountain Way - Joe Walsh\n38: Check It Out - Tavares\n37: Get It Together - Jackson 5\n36: China Grove - Doobie Brothers\n35: The Most Beautiful Girl - Charlie Rich\n34: Ecstasy - The Ohio Players\n33: Jesse - Roberta Flack\n32: Funky Stuff - Kool &amp; The Gang\n31: Free Ride - The Edgar Winter Group\n30: Nutbush City Limits - Ike And Tina Turner\n29: Cheaper To Keep Her - Johnny Taylor\n28: My Maria - B.W.
