While Episode 1 was free to play,\n  starting with Episode 2 the rest of the season has to be purchased.\n\n  Game information:\n  =================\n\n  Every time we wake up on the other side we have a small chance of  falling\n  in to never ending dream. Honestly - which side is the true one?  We  wake\n  up in our beds, but is it possible to remember second awakening?\n\n  You remember well what you have done in your dream, what happend, who  was\n  there and what was your goal or desire. Yes, but WHEN you  have  woke  up?\n  When you have crossed the barrier? How you have entered that world and why\n  it often ends in some sort of tragedy, that pushes you out? The only thing\n  that left are memories of dream. Shattered memories, Haunted Memories.\n\n  Now you have a chance to visit this haunted  realm  consciously,  but  you\n  have to be warned. Remember - once entered, can't be left. To the very end\n  of your sanity, all six episodes of Haunted Memories are going to show you\n  that sometimes darkness leads to light.\n\n  Features:\n  =========\n\n  * Reveal past, present and future of your fate\n  * Meet others who have fallen into the realm.\n    Help them or condemn to eternal dreaming.\n  * Discover what really happend to Mark Slender and\n    why he let you out from his nightmare.\n  * Explore immersive world directed in 100% by original Ã‚â€žHaunt&quot;\n    team.
