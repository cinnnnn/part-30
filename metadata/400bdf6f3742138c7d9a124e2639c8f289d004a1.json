But it has been a long time since I played this game, so I thought of playing it and found some graphics glitches with my new card (GTX 650). \n\n\nIt was a big headache to me as I cannot play the game, only I can see the loading screen with some green color lines crossed over. After a pain taking search for the fix in all the forums, I am happy to tell you that I have got it :)\n\nInstructions:\n-------------\n1.  Download this torrent -----&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3373055/PC_-_Project_IGI_1_-_Im_Going_In_-_Full_ISO_._No_RIP_SHIT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3373055/PC_-_Project_IGI_1_-_Im_Going_In_-_Full_ISO_._No_RIP_SHIT&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2. Install the game, then copy and paste the two files from the folder &quot;crack&quot; to your installation directory and replace the files, then run the patch&quot;Crack Project IGI&quot;.
