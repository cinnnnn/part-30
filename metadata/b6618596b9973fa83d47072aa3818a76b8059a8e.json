GIS on the web means using tools like Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Esri to create map mashups: multilayered visualizations that combine data from multiple sources. In this course, Jason VanHorn shows how to use these tools to analyze geodata and create interactive, mobile-ready maps that communicate your ideas better than ever before.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding map mashups\n    Finding coordinates\n    Mapping with Google Drive\n    Geocoding with addresses and coordinates\n    Merging data\n    Analyzing your map\n    Adding GIS layers from services or a file\n    Working with the Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Esri APIs\n    Sharing and publishing your work\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6618596b9973fa83d47072aa3818a76b8059a8e","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+GIS+on+the+Web+with+Jason+VanHorn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6618596b9973fa83d47072aa3818a76b8059a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,97,133,150,185,151,63,168,61,71,7,42,163,129,138,118,184,5,154,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
