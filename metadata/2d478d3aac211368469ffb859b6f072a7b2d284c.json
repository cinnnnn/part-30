The agitprop event from the back of a flat-bed truck drew more than 10,000 people out of the nearby office buildings and onto the street. \n\nThe Oils were responding to one of the worst environmental disasters in US history when nearly 11 million gallons of oil were spilled onto the pristine Alaskan coastline by the Exxon Valdez. Twenty five years later the effects of the spill on the landscapes and wildlife of southern Alaska are still being felt.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There are things we think are so important that they have to be said,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lead singer Peter Garrett told a packed international press conference after the performance, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and the best way we could say it was with song. What happened this morning was just another of the things that this band has tried to do for the last decade or so. We want to take some of the issues that are in the songs back onto the streets where they belong.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe DVD features all six songs captured live that day: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ProgressÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (From the 1986 EP, Species Deceases); Ã¢â‚¬Å“SometimesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DreamworldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (from 1987Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Diesel And Dust); Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue Sky MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“River Runs RedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (from Blue Sky Mining, 1990); the apropos tribute to John Lennon, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instant KarmaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the video clip for Midnight OilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“King Of The MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (also from Blue Sky Mining), plus commentary on each track from the band.\n\nIn addition to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack Rain FallsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ release Sony Music is for the first time releasing the physical remastered versions of these 8 classic Midnight Oil albums: Midnight Oil, Head Injuries, Place Without A Postcard, 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 , Red Sails In The Sunset, Diesel And Dust, Blue Sky Mining, and Earth And Sun And Moon, as well as the EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bird Noises and Species Deceases. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe Making of Midnight OilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at Manly Art Gallery and Museum is a major public exhibition celebrating the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpower and the passionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most inspirational rock bands.\n\nDeveloped by MAG&amp;MÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ross Heathcote in collaboration with Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst and with exhibition design by Wendy Osmond, The Making of Midnight Oil will examine the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on our social and cultural history across a 40 year period. \n\nAs Rob Hirst puts it Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe first crowd we ever pulled was on the Northern Beaches Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a long-demolished surf-pub called the Royal Antler Hotel. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fitting that our first ever exhibition is in Manly, where some of us still live and make music. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Midnight Oil exhibition, sure. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the story of a time when music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ loud, fast and original Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was all that mattered. And about the bands and the beer-halls and the smoky, sweaty, sticky joy of it all.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \n\nThe exhibition will showcase rare and iconic items including stage props, instruments, protest banners, hand written lyrics, photographs and posters sourced from public and private collections as well as the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own archives. It will also highlight the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s various actions across the years including the original 30 ft wide banner from the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack Rain FallsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ concert with the wording Ã¢â‚¬ËœMidnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us SickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \n\nAbout Midnight Oil:\n\nFrom their beginnings in the 1970s on the pub circuit of SydneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Northern beaches Midnight Oil went on to win audiences across the world with their fierce commitment to environmental, social, anti-war and indigenous rights issues.\n\nWith nearly a dozen songs on the Billboard charts and their album Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeds Are BurningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ topping the list of 100 Best Australian Albums Of All Time, Midnight Oil were not only a musical force to be reckoned with, but a band whose conscience resonated with audiences not just in Australia, but in the USA, Canada, South America, South Africa and across Europe.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.midnightoil.com/news/midnight-oil%E2%80%99s-historic-guerilla-protest-concert-%E2%80%98black-rain-falls%E2%80%99-released-friday-june-20th&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.midnightoil.com/news/midnight-oil%E2%80%99s-historic-guerilla-protest-concert-%E2%80%98black-rain-falls%E2%80%99-released-friday-june-20th&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d478d3aac211368469ffb859b6f072a7b2d284c","amp;dn":"Midnight+Oil+-+Black+Rain+Falls+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d478d3aac211368469ffb859b6f072a7b2d284c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,71,141,58,172,33,19,104,70,159,251,133,155,111,7,42,123,45,40,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
