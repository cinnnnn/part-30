Growing up in his lavish estate, Dido was raised as a sister and companion to her white cousin, Elizabeth. When a joint portrait of the girls, commissioned by Mansfield, was unveiled, eighteenth-century England was shocked to see a black woman and white woman depicted as equals. Inspired by the painting, Belle vividly brings to life this extraordinary woman caught between two worlds, and illuminates the great civil rights question of her age: the fight to end slavery.\n\nBelle includes 20 pages of black-and-white photos.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7871f478f19989340a615d63d56da89d4593b08f","amp;dn":"Belle+%28Paula+Byrne%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7871f478f19989340a615d63d56da89d4593b08f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,113,244,120,241,153,137,52,10,97,93,99,213,109,168,157,69,147,176,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
