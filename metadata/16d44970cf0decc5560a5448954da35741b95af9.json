Blame the people who mastered the album, not me.  Quality is much better than anything else out there so far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d44970cf0decc5560a5448954da35741b95af9","amp;dn":"Toya+-+Toya+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d44970cf0decc5560a5448954da35741b95af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,212,73,112,207,13,236,197,86,10,84,72,149,77,163,87,65,185,90,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
