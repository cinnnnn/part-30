A general consensus from health experts has confirmed that an increased dietary intake of antioxidant compounds found in most fresh produce types may protect against oxidative damage caused by free radicals and reduce the incidence of certain cancers and chronic diseases. Currently there is no book available which collectively discusses and reviews empirical data on health-promoting properties of all fresh produce types, and the proposed book will provide detailed information on identity, nature, bioavailablity, chemopreventative effects, and postharvest stability of specific chemical classes with known bioactive properties. In addition, chapters discuss the various methodologies for extraction, isolation, characterisation and quantification of bioactive compounds and the in-vitro and in-vivo anticancer assays. It will be an essential resource for researchers and students in food science, nutrition and fruit and vegetable production.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038315413c30d3870a473ac1ae2165d1cde4e181","amp;dn":"Health-promoting+Properties+of+Fruits+and+Vegetables","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038315413c30d3870a473ac1ae2165d1cde4e181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,131,21,65,60,48,211,135,10,71,58,193,174,33,101,209,205,228,225,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
