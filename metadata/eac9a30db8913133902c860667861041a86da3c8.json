He was born in Sofia into a family with a gypsy background. His father was the conductor of an orchestra that was often heard on radio Sofia.\n\nAt an early age Boris was already passionate about folk music, played first on the ocarina and later on the tambura in his father's orchestra. Here he acquired a feeling for the harmonic structure of Bulgarian music. At twelve years of age Karlov began to play the accordion, beginning with a simple 48-base Hohner instrument, and progressing to a 120-base. Eventually he had a custom Italian Scandalli accordion made for him.\n\nIn the years 1950ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1960, Karlov was in demand not only in Bulgaria, but also in Yugoslavia and Austria. He had a busy concert schedule and favourable reviews. Karlov developed a style of playing which was new on the accordion. Based on generally short, simple, but fast musical phrases, frequently in the irregular rhythms that were originally played on traditional Bulgarian instruments such as the gaida (bagpipe) and kaval (end-blown flute), he innovated a rondo form where the special character of Bulgarian music nevertheless remained.\n\nHe died, still on tour, in Kraljevo, of a kidney infection&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eac9a30db8913133902c860667861041a86da3c8","amp;dn":"Boris+Karlov+%28bulgarian+gypsy-accordeon%29+1924-1964+-+2CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eac9a30db8913133902c860667861041a86da3c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,201,163,13,184,145,49,51,144,44,134,6,103,134,16,65,168,109,163,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
