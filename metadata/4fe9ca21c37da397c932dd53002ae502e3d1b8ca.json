This movie, the 11th, chronicles Ash, Dawn, and Brock's adventures with the legendary Pokemon Shaymin.\n\nThe story covers the existence of a Reverse World where the legendary Pokemon Giratina lives, and its connections to the real world. The villain seeks to exploit Giratina and those connections, theoretically for noble purposes; realistically out of sheer madness. The heroes and Shaymin get caught up in the mayhem.\n\nAudio : English AAC-2channel\n\nSub : English (vob)\n\nx264\n\n672x352\n\nPlaytime : 1h 36mn\n\nbit rate : 1000kbps\n\nSource : Pokemon Giratina and The Sky Warrior 2009 NTSC DVDR-INSECT\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fe9ca21c37da397c932dd53002ae502e3d1b8ca","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Giratina+and+The+Sky+Warrior+2009+DVDRip+x264-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fe9ca21c37da397c932dd53002ae502e3d1b8ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,233,202,33,195,125,163,151,201,50,221,83,0,42,229,2,227,209,184,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
