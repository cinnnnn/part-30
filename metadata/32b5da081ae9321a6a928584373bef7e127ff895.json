Allen and Cox first teamed in the group Rema Rema, which also featured Adam &amp; the Ants alum Marco Perroni; after reuniting in the short-lived quartet Mass, the duo recruited Gray, and as the Wolfgang Press issued their cacophonous, gloomy debut LP, The Burden of Mules, in 1983. An EP trilogy co-produced by Cocteau Twin Robin Guthrie followed in quick succession: while 1984s Scarecrow was a lighter, more streamlined affair, 1985s Water spotlighted ominously sparse torch songs, and the same years Sweatbox explored deconstructionist pop.\n\n1.
