The strong Cuban influence in the music (obvious not only in the rhythms, but also in the horn charts of a track like &quot;Kolangoman&quot;) helped bring them local fame in the mid-'70s before Keita embarked on a solo career. With some stunning, but laid-back, guitar work from Kante Manfila, this record moves at a wonderful pace, never straining at the leash, but more danceable than 12 albums of funk. Compiled from the band's Malian releases, it offers a good cross-section of what they achieved (however, it's worth noting that &quot;Mousso Gnaleden&quot; was recorded after Keita's departure with a different vocalist), and how they could indulge in a song without it ever being forced. An absolute delight. --Chris Nickson (Amazon.com)\n\nFLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c95e464f31f1a0a5c2df145baab4704c47d49a3","amp;dn":"Les+Ambassadeurs+Internationales+%28feat.+Salif+Keita%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c95e464f31f1a0a5c2df145baab4704c47d49a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,149,228,100,243,31,26,10,92,45,241,69,186,171,71,4,196,125,73,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
