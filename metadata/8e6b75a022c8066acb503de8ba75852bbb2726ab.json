Nanites, power suits, superhuman strength and intelligence versus hordes of raging orcs armed with crude weapons and dark magic. Okay, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not completely accurate. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one cyborg, at least until the assimilating begins, and while there are plenty of orcs, most of the fights are against the same one. So, maybe Ã¢â‚¬Å“cyborg versus orcÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would be more accurate.\n\nStill, with a premise like that, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of fodder for great stories, once you consider what else would be in a world that produces orcs and cyborgs: AIs and computers and starships, vampires and wizards and necromancy. And what happens when you combine them: orcs who can sense radio signals, flying humans created by technology? Robert Sier has managed to find a place for all of these things in his book, and the only question is with so much material, where do you begin.&quot;\n\n-Donald Crankshaw, Black Gate Magazine, March 1, 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blackgate.com/2013/03/01/self-published-book-reviews-chains-of-loss-by-robert-sier/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blackgate.com/2013/03/01/self-published-book-reviews-chains-of-loss-by-robert-sier/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6b75a022c8066acb503de8ba75852bbb2726ab","amp;dn":"Chains+of+Loss+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6b75a022c8066acb503de8ba75852bbb2726ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,107,117,160,34,200,6,106,203,80,61,232,186,117,133,43,187,39,38,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
