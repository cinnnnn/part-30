Wittrisch, H. Cholet (Ã‰ditions Technip, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-2-7108-0998-2\r\n\r\nThe progressing cavity pump (PCP), invented by RenÃ© Moineau, is a great innovation for the whole industry, particularly in petroleum production. The aim of this new edition is to provide clear related and condensed information about the principles of the progressing cavity pump, including the use of recent material technologies to manufacture pump stators, with advanced elastomers and now with metals. The same applies to the drive rods and driving head, particularly with permanent magnet motors and advanced control and well monitoring, with downhole and surface sensors to control and monitor the pumping system. Software is used to select the best pump for the well candidate. All these new technologies mean that well production can be increased and the PCPâ€™s operating life can be extended with reduced operating costs. This book is intended to provide the criteria for selecting a progressing cavity pump and the operational conditions for its implementation by technicians and field development managers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53976a91c57333ed6dd241d4c49b47d2e65e846f","amp;dn":"Progressing+Cavity+Pumps+-+Oil+Well+Production+Artificial+Lift+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53976a91c57333ed6dd241d4c49b47d2e65e846f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,151,106,145,197,115,51,237,109,210,65,212,196,155,71,210,230,94,132,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
