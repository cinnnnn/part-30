The star here is Cia Cherryholmes, the banjo-playing daughter who composes most of the album&amp;#039;s original material and ranks with Alison Krauss as a vocalist on highlights such as the opening &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know What Love Is&quot; and the prison-ballad title track. Yet the instrumental interplay and harmonies reflect the sextet&amp;#039;s blood ties, while the range of material bridges the traditional and progressive (it&amp;#039;s hard to hear Cia&amp;#039;s &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Give Your Heart to a Knoxville Girl,&quot; sung by brother B.J., without thinking of the Louvin Brothers&amp;#039; classic &quot;Knoxville Girl&quot;).\n\n-=AMG Review=- by James Christopher Monger\n\nNashville, TN, may be crawling with swarms of singing, clogging, clawhammering family bluegrass bands, but none have the sheer streamlined acumen of Cherryholmes. Boasting two generations, this Music City by way of Arizona sextet&amp;#039;s second album, Cherryholmes II: Black and White, has all of the technical and harmony-laden power of Ricky Skaggs &amp; Kentucky Thunder, all of the polished rock &amp; roll-infused delivery of Diamond Rio, and a vocalist (and excellent banjo player) in daughter Cia Cherryholmes, who could give the esteemed Alison Krauss a run for her money. Another plus is the group&amp;#039;s dedication to performing almost all original tunes, the best of which (&quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know What Love Is,&quot; &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Give Your Heart to a Knoxville Girl,&quot; and &quot;Turned Me Down&quot; were penned by Cia. That&amp;#039;s not to discredit B.J., Sandy, and Molly, all of whom display a real gift for the genre, and the playing is as electrifying as the cheesy lightning bolts that grace the cover. Cherryholmes look the part, sound the part, but best of all they feel real enough to transcend all of the industry trappings that can sometimes turn real, honest to God bluegrass acts into gift shop commodities. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCherryholmes - Cherryholmes II (Black and White)\n\nArtist     -  Cherryholmes\nTitle      -  Cherryholmes II (Black and White)\nGenre      -  Bluegrass\nYear       -  2007\nEncoder    -  LAME3.97 (V2)\nBitrate    -  VBRkbps\nQuality    -  Joint-Stereo\nkHz        -  44.1kHz\nSource     -  CDDA\nDate       -  Jul-12-2007\nType       -  Album\nTracks     -  14\nPlay Time  -  48:55 min\nSize       -  59,5 MB\nLable      -  Skaggs Family Records\nCat.Nr     -  B000QXDJBS\nURL        -  n/a\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n[01] you don&amp;#039;t know what love is                                       [03:2\n[02] heat of the morning                                               [03:2\n[03] i don&amp;#039;t know                                                      [02:5\n[04] black and white                                                   [05:2\n[05] the nine yards                                                    [02:5\n[06] turning me down                                                   [03:2\n[07] darkness on the delta                                             [03:0\n[08] don&amp;#039;t give your heart to a knoxville girl                         [02:5\n[09] my true love                                                      [03:2\n[10] bootstrap bill                                                    [02:2\n[11] tell me why                                                       [03:3\n[12] mansion of kings                                                  [04:3\n[13] i&amp;#039;ll never shed another tear                                      [03:1\n[14] greedy hands                                                      [04:0\n\n\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nThough the lightning crackling across the CD cover suggests a\nheavy-metal band (or perhaps a cross between the Addams Family and\na Black Oak Arkansas reunion), the second release by Cherryholmes\non Ricky Skaggs&amp;#039;s label establishes the family band as one of the\nmost promising acts in contemporary bluegrass.
