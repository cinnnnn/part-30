I. Gurdjieff. The All and Everything trilogy also includes Meetings with Remarkable Men (first published in 1963) and Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am' (first privately printed in 1974).\n\nBecause the book was intended to be the main study tool for his teachings, and because the idea of work is central to those teachings, Gurdjieff went to great lengths in order to increase the effort needed to read and understand it. Gurdjieff himself once said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I bury the bone so deep that the dogs have to scratch for it.&quot; [1] The book treats of an enormous number of subjects and questions. It is a vast allegorical myth structure in a literary form all its own.[2]\n\nThe plot of Beelzebub's Tales primarily revolves around the ruminations of an extraterrestrial known as &quot;Beelzebub&quot; to his grandson Hassein, as they travel through space towards Beelzebub's home planet &quot;Karatas&quot; on the spaceship Karnak. It mainly recounts the adventures and travails of Beelzebub amongst the 'three-brained beings' (humans) of the planet Earth. Beelzebub covers the entire history of the strange behaviors and customs of these beings.\n\nBeelzebub's Tales is included in Martin Seymour-Smith's 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written, with the comment that it is &quot;...the most convincing fusion of Eastern and Western thought has yet been seen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef737419004430589a5510c51716314fb1ef36fd","amp;dn":"Beelzebub%27s+Tales+to+His+Grandson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef737419004430589a5510c51716314fb1ef36fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,115,116,25,0,68,48,88,154,85,16,197,23,22,49,79,177,239,54,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
