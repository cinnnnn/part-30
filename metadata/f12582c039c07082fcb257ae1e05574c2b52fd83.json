Both Blackman and Wagner, along with guitarist Johnny Walker, had previous success with Mississippi-based &quot;sunshine pop&quot; group Eternity's Children, scoring a Billboard Hot 100 hit with &quot;Mrs. Bluebird&quot; in the summer of 1968.\n\nStarbuck's debut single, &quot;Moonlight Feels Right&quot;, reached the #3 position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in 1976. Although the band never re-created the success of their debut, several of their songs did chart in the Billboard Top 100 and their 1977 release &quot;Everybody Be Dancin'&quot; reached #38.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1980, the band toured with popular groups of the era including ELO, KC &amp; the Sunshine Band, Hall &amp; Oates and Boston. TV appearances included The Midnight Special, American Bandstand, The Merv Griffin Show, Dinah!, The Mike Douglas Show and Solid Gold.\n\n\n256 Kbps\n\nCD Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12582c039c07082fcb257ae1e05574c2b52fd83","amp;dn":"Starbuck+-+The+Very+Best+of+Starbuck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12582c039c07082fcb257ae1e05574c2b52fd83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,37,130,192,57,192,112,130,252,178,87,174,30,5,87,76,43,82,253,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
