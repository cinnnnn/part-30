Stecyk III (aka: Craig Stecyk), Greg Escalante, and Eric Swenson[1] to both help define and celebrate urban alternative and underground contemporary art. It was edited from 1996 to 2006 by Jamie O'Shea. Juxtapoz is published by High Speed Productions, the same company that publishes Thrasher Skateboard magazine in San Francisco, California.\n\nJuxtapoz launched with the mission of connecting modern genres like psychedelic and hot rod art, graffiti, street art, and illustration, to the context of broader more historically recognized genres of art like Pop, assemblage, old master painting, and conceptual art. Although based in San Francisco, Juxtapoz was founded upon the belief in the virtues of Southern California Pop Culture and the freedom from the conventions of the &quot;established&quot; New York art world. Ferus Gallery, run by Walter Hopps and Irving Blum in the 1950s and 1960s was the ultimate cultural touchstone for the magazine.\n\nPdf\n\n148 Pages\n\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56fdff0c6ddfa882ac3e6dc35d2bf361f0f1d523","amp;dn":"Juxtapoz+Magazine-+Sept+%2C2012+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56fdff0c6ddfa882ac3e6dc35d2bf361f0f1d523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,253,255,12,109,223,168,130,172,62,109,195,93,43,243,97,240,241,213,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
