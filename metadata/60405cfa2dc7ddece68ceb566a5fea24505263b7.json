It was released \nfree online via Google Video in June of 2007. A remastered version \nwas presented as a global premiere on November 10, 2007 at the 4th \nAnnual Artivist Film Festival &amp; Artivist Awards. The creator lists \nsources and an interactive transcript (which goes into more details) \non his website (See link below)\n\nPart I: The Greatest Story Ever Told\nPart I evaluates Christian beliefs established in the Bible and \ncritiques the historicity of the Bible. In furtherance of the Jesus \nmyth hypothesis, this part argues that the historical Jesus is a literary \nand astrological hybrid, and that the Bible is based on astrological \nprinciples documented by many ancient civilizations, especially pertaining \nto movement of the sun through the sky and stars. The movie specifically \nmentions the story links between Jesus Christ and the Egyptian Sun God Horus.\nAccording to the movie, Religion and myths in general can be used to \nmotivate people to be good or remember important astrological occurrences, \nbut ultimately if the majority of people believe in something that is not true, \nthen they are in danger of being controlled (or oppressed).\n\n\nPart II: All the World\\'s a Stage\nAccording to Part II, the United States was warned about the \nimpending September 11, 2001 attacks, that NORAD was purposely \nconfused through wargames to allow the planes to reach their targets, \nand how the World Trade Center buildings underwent a controlled demolition. \nAdditionally, the film argues that six of the named hijackers are still alive, \nthat Hani Hanjour could not have flown Flight 77 into the Pentagon, \nthat the Bush Administration covered up the truth in the 9/11 Commission Report, \nand that the mainstream media has failed to ask important questions about the \nofficial account. The movie claims 9/11 was engineered to remove the rights of \nthe citizens and make more money for those in power.\n\n\nPart III: Don\\'t Mind the Men Behind the Curtain\nAccording to Part III, powerful bankers have been conspiring for world domination \nand increased power and the rich of society have been using their wealth to \nincrease financial panic and foster a consolidation of independent competing banks. \nThe film details the Theory of Electronic Conspiracy and claims that the \nFederal Reserve System, the central bank of the United States, was created in \norder to steal the wealth of the nation. It makes claims of war profiteering by \na rich few. It describes the goal of these \nbankers as world power over a controllable public. This section also claims that \nthere is a clandestine movement to usurp the American constitution and dollar \nby merging the United States, Canada and Mexico into a North American Union, \na super-state similar to the European Union, which the movie maintains, together \nalongside with the African Union and the proposed Asian Union, will gradually be \nmerged into a One World government. The movie concludes that under such a government, \nevery human being will be implanted with a RFID microchip which will be used to \nmonitor individuals and suppress dissent. The movie ends, however, on an optimistic \nnote, expressing confidence at the overthrow of oppressive forces and the ultimate \ntriumph of revolution.\n\n\nRun Time: 2 hr 2 min\n\nZEITGEIST SWEDISH SUBTITLES\nmed Svensk undertext\n\n\n#################################################################################\n#                                                                               #\n# 1.
