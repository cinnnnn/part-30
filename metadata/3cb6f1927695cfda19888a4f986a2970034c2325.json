If nothing else, give them an honest review.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb6f1927695cfda19888a4f986a2970034c2325","amp;dn":"A+Devil%27s+Chronicle+-+Corin+Hamilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb6f1927695cfda19888a4f986a2970034c2325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,182,241,146,118,149,207,218,25,136,138,79,152,106,41,112,3,76,35,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
