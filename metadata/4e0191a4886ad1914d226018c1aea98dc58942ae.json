The ferocious fish themselves take a surprising backseat plot-wise, the real focus of the movie is some claptrap about a government conspiracy. As that plot is pretty inane, the whole film suffers for it and becomes tediously boring because of it. Co-written and directed by Wayne Crawford, who'd have a later hit with &quot;Valley Girl&quot; and the equally ridiculous but more fun (in it's own campy way)&quot;Snake Island&quot;. You would do better to give either of those two a rent and skip this one.\n\nMy Grade: C\n\nDark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for various drive-in food; and Trailers for &quot;Bonnie's Kids&quot; (features nudity), &quot;the Centerfold Girls&quot;, &quot;Part-time Wife&quot; (features nudity), &quot;Psychic Killer&quot;, &amp; &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;. The DVD also comes with 1983's &quot;Please don't eat the babies&quot; (AKA: Island Fury)\n\n(By the way - I, the uploader, diasgree with this review, I give the movie a 'B', I liked it!)\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/naadmaadi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/naadmaadi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/naadoaadi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/naadoaadi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oaadaaadi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/oaadaaadi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0191a4886ad1914d226018c1aea98dc58942ae","amp;dn":"Barracuda+%281978%29+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0191a4886ad1914d226018c1aea98dc58942ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,1,145,164,136,106,209,145,77,34,96,24,193,174,169,141,197,137,66,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
