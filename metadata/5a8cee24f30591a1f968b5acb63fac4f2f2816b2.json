It is considered by fans and critics to be Keaton still in top form, and it was added to the National Film Registry in 2005 as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\nWithin a little over a year, however, M-G-M would remove creative control over his pictures from Keaton, thereby causing drastic and long-lasting harm to his career. Keaton was later to call the move to MGM &quot;the worst mistake of my career&quot;.\n\nThe film was well received by film critics.\n\nCritic Mordaunt Hall, writing for the New York Times, liked the film and the work of Buster Keaton. He said, &quot;Mr. Keaton&amp;#039;s latest effort is &quot;The Cameraman&quot;, which is filled with guffaws and grins, the sort of thing with many original and adroitly worked-out gags. But whether they belong to the story is immaterial...There are other sections that are wild and watery, but nonetheless humorous&quot;.\n\nAs of January 8, 2008, The Cameraman is number 331 on &quot;They Shoot Pictures Don&amp;#039;t They?&quot; 1000 Greatest Movies of All Time.\n\nIn 2005 the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\nIMDB: 8.2/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018742/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018742/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a8cee24f30591a1f968b5acb63fac4f2f2816b2","amp;dn":"The+Cameraman+%281928%29.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a8cee24f30591a1f968b5acb63fac4f2f2816b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,140,238,36,243,5,145,161,249,104,181,172,182,63,172,79,47,40,22,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
