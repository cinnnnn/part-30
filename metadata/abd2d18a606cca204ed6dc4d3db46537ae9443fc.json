At an early age he decided to imitate his favorite singer, Frank Sinatra, and began taking voice lessons. After his father became injured at work, he had to drop out of school and he took a job as an usher and elevator operator in a movie theater, the Paramount, in Manhattan.\n\nPerry Como visited the theater and Damone took Como to his dressing room to perform for him. Como liked the performance enough to take him under his wing, and referred him to a local bandleader. At this time, he took the name of Damone, his Italian mother&amp;#039;s maiden name.\n\n\nDamone entered the talent search on Arthur Godfrey&amp;#039;s Talent Scouts and won the competition in April, 1947. Winning that contest led to his getting a regular role on Godfrey&amp;#039;s show (a step that figured in the careers of many other Talent Scouts winners). One day he ran into Milton Berle at the station and Berle got him a chance to do regular shows at two night clubs. By the middle of 1947, he had a contract with Mercury Records.\n\nHis first release, &quot;I Have But One Heart&quot; (August 30) reached #7 on the Billboard chart. &quot;You Do&quot; (released November 1) reached the same peak. These were followed by a number of other hits. In 1948 he got his own weekly radio show, Saturday Night Serenade.\n\nIn 1951, Damone appeared in two movies: The Strip and Rich, Young, and Pretty. From 1951 to 1953 he served in the United States Army, but before going into the service he recorded a number of songs which were released during that time. After leaving the service, he married an Italian American actress, Anna Maria Pierangeli, and in 1954 made two more movies: Deep In My Heart and Athena. He also made some guest appearances on Milton Berle&amp;#039;s television show in 1954.\n\n1955 was a poor year for Damone.[neutrality disputed] He only had one song on the charts, &quot;Por Favor,&quot; which did not make it above #73. However, he did have a major role in the movie musical, &quot;Kismet&quot; in 1955. In early 1956, he was dropped by Mercury, but was able to sign with Columbia Records and had some success on that label with hits like &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; (from My Fair Lady,his final pop top ten) and &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (from the movie of the same name).\n\nIn 1961 he was released by Columbia, moving over to Capitol Records, where he filled in the gap left by Frank Sinatra&amp;#039;s leaving to help found Reprise Records. He lasted at Capitol until 1965, however, but he recorded some of his most highly-regarded albums there, including two which made the Billboard chart, Linger Awhile with Vic Damone and The Lively Ones, the latter with arrangements by Billy May, who also arranged another of Damone&amp;#039;s Capitol albums, Strange Enchantment. Damone moved next to Warner Bros. Records. On Warners he had one chart hit: &quot;You Were Only Fooling (While I Was Falling In Love).&quot; The next year he moved again, to RCA Records, but in 1969 he released his last US chart record, a cover of the 1966 song &quot;To Make A Big Man Cry&quot;, which made Billboard&amp;#039;s Easy Listening chart.\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Damone started touring Las Vegas casinos as a performer, and although he had to declare bankruptcy in the early 1970s, he earned enough as a casino performer to clear up his financial difficulties[1]. He extended his geographical range, touring through the United States and the United Kingdom, and as a result of his popularity decided to record some albums again, releasing them on the RCA label.\n\nHis final album was issued in 1997, with other albums being re-packaged and re-released.\n\n\nDamone has married five times, divorced four. His marriage to Italian actress Anna Maria Pierangeli ended in 1958. Damone was married from 1987 to 1996 to an American entertainer, Diahann Carroll. She was his fourth wife. This relationship is referenced in the 1997 film Money Talks, in which Chris Tucker&amp;#039;s character claims to be Vic Damone Jr., the son of Damone and Carroll[2].\n\nHe has three daughters from his second marriage to Judith Rawlins and one son from his first union to Anna Maria Pierangeli. In 1998 he married Rena Rowan, fashion designer and co-creator of Jones New York (Jones Apparel Group). Damone has 6 grandchildren from his daughters.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Damone was introduced to the BahÃƒÂ¡&amp;#039;ÃƒÂ­ Faith by a drummer in his band. Damone relates his rendition of &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; incorporates gestures meant to summon a sustaining vitality from `Abdu&amp;#039;l-BahÃƒÂ¡. He officially joined the religion in the early 1960s.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, Damone received his high school diploma from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn when officials with the school granted credits for life experience and asked him to give the commencement address - advising students to &quot;Have spiritual guidance. Don&amp;#039;t lose God. There is a God. Trust me.&quot;\n\nIn 1997, Damone received the &quot;Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[5] Frank Sinatra said that Damone had &quot;the best set of pipes in the business&quot;.\n\nFor his contribution to the recording industry, Vic Damone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVic Damone - My Baby Loves To Swing  1962\n\n\n01 - I&amp;#039;m Nobody&amp;#039;s Baby\n02 - Everybody Loves My Baby\n03 - You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby\n04 - Alright, Okay, You Win\n05 - My Melancholy Baby\n06 - Let&amp;#039;s Sit This One Out\n07 - My Baby Loves To Swing\n08 - My Baby Just Cares For Me\n09 - Is You Is, Or Is You Ain&amp;#039;t?\n10 - Baby, Baby All The Time\n11 - Baby Won&amp;#039;t You Please Come Home\n12 - Make This A Slow Goodbye\n\n\n\n\nVic Damone - Strange Enchantment  1962\n\n\n01 - Strange Enchantment\n02 - The Hawaiian Wedding Song\n03 - Shangri-La\n04 - Humming Waters\n05 - Poinciana\n06 - Flamingo\n07 - Beyond The Reef\n08 - You&amp;#039;re Lovable\n09 - The Moon Of Manakoora\n10 - Bali Ha&amp;#039;i\n11 - Forevermore\n12 - Ebb Tide\n\n\n\n\n\nVic Damone - That Towering Feeling 1956\n\n01 - You Stepped Out Of A Dream\n02 - Wait Till You See Her\n03 - Out Of Nowhere\n04 - The Song Is You\n05 - Spring Is Here\n06 - Let&amp;#039;s Fall In Love\n07 - (When Your Heart&amp;#039;s On Fire) Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n08 - Time On My Hands (You In My Arms)\n09 - I&amp;#039;m Glad There Is You\n10 - The Touch Of Your Lips\n11 - All The Things You Are\n12 - Cheek To Cheek\n\n\n\n\n\nVic Damone - The Lively Ones  1962\n\n01 - Charmaine\n02 - Cherokee\n03 - Laura\n04 - Diane\n05 - Nina Never Knew\n06 - The Lively Ones\n07 - Marie\n08 - The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\n09 - Ruby\n10 - Dearly Beloved\n11 - I Want A Little Girl\n12 - Little Girl\n\n\n\n\n\nVic Damone - Linger Awhile  1962\n\n01 - Linger Awhile\n02 - Close Your Eyes\n03 - Stella By Starlight\n04 - Change Partners\n05 - After The Lights Go Down\n06 - Let&amp;#039;s Face The Music And Dance\n07 - Soft Lights And Sweet Music\n08 - Deep Night\n09 - One Love\n10 - There!
