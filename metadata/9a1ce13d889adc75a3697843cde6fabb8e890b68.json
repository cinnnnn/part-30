From her 1971 debut through 1982's Green Light, she had a solid streak, \n but 1986's Nine Lives snapped it, falling far short of her usual potential. \n Therefore, it shouldn't have been a surprise when Raitt decided to craft its \n follow-up as a major comeback, collaborating with producer Don Was on Nick of Time. \n At the time, the pairing seemed a little odd, since he was primarily known for the \n weird hipster funk of Was (Not Was) and the B-52's' quirky eponymous debut, but the \n match turned out to be inspired. Was used Raitt's classic early-'70s records as a \n blueprint, choosing to update the sound with a smooth, professional production and a \n batch of excellent contemporary songs. In this context, Raitt flourishes; she never \n rocks too hard, but there is grit to her singing and playing, even when the surfaces \n are clean and inviting. And while she only has two original songs here, Nick of Time \n plays like autobiography, which is a testament to the power of the songs, \n performances, and productions. It was a great comeback album that made for a great \n story, but the record never would have been a blockbuster success if it wasn't for \n the music, which is among the finest Raitt ever made. She must have realized this, \n since Nick of Time served as the blueprint for the majority of her '90s albums. -- \n Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Nick of time [03:53] \n 02.Thing called love [03:52] \n 03.Love letter [04:05] \n 04.Cry on my shoulder [03:44] \n 05.Real man [04:27] \n 06.Nobody's girl [03:15] \n 07.Have A heart [04:50] \n 08.Too soon to tell [03:46] \n 09.I will not be denied [04:55] \n 10.I ain't gonna let you [02:38] \n break my heart again \n 11.The road's my middle name [03:32] \n ____ \n \n 42:57 min \n 58,7 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1ce13d889adc75a3697843cde6fabb8e890b68","amp;dn":"Bonnie_Raitt-Nick_Of_Time-%28Retail%29-1989-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1ce13d889adc75a3697843cde6fabb8e890b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,28,225,61,136,154,220,117,163,105,120,67,205,230,250,187,142,137,11,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
