Now, he would delegate much of the work to younger musicians, who used synthesizers and other electronic instruments to create the music. Keyboardist Robert Irving III composed and arranged much of the music on Decoy, which features John Scofield on guitar, Branford Marsalis on soprano saxophone and Darryl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MunchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jones on bass. The energetic title track is a classic, while the bluesy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Right,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an 11-minute epic with fine performances from everyone. Decoy also includes two highly-charged live funk numbers\n\n\n1.&quot;Decoy&quot;  8:33\n2.&quot;Robot 415&quot; 1:09\n3.&quot;Code M.D.&quot; 5:58\n4.&quot;Freaky Deaky&quot; 4:34\n5.&quot;What It Is&quot; (Recorded live) 4:31\n6.&quot;That's Right&quot; 11:12\n7.&quot;That's What Happened&quot;  (Recorded live)  3:30\n\nPersonnel\n\nMiles Davis - trumpet, synthesizer, arrangements\nBill Evans - soprano saxophone\nBranford Marsalis - soprano saxophone\nRobert Irving III - synthesizer, synthesizer bass &amp; drum programming\nJohn Scofield - guitar\nDarryl &quot;The Munch&quot; Jones - bass\nAl Foster - drums\nMino Cinelu - percussion\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8282fce67e88bc9fb73762013769f66e15605c4","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+Decoy+%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8282fce67e88bc9fb73762013769f66e15605c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,40,47,206,103,232,139,201,251,115,118,32,19,118,159,102,225,86,5,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
