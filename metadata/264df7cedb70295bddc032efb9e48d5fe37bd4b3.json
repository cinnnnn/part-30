Do something for yourself today to bring your hopes and dreams into reality.\n\nYou can. You really can. Whether you are a student, adult, or senior.\n\nLife is too short to wait a minute longer.\n\nIntroducing...\n\nClear Mind ~ Bright Future\n\nA CD-ROM program to turn your hopes and dreams into realistic, absolutely attainable goals, targets that make sense for you as an unique and wonderful individual.\n\n      guided visualizations\n      creative brainstorming sessions\n      the ancient &quot;Master Formula of Attainment&quot;\n      inner mind conditioning and programming \n\n\n\nIn just a couple of hours, international learning expert Paul Scheele will help you discover your guiding purpose in life, sort out what you really want, create a workable path, and get you going to actually realizing your hopes and dreams.\n\nNote: this is not the typical goal setting program. This is fun, energizing, and motivating.\n\nEven though most people don't like goal setting, I love it.

Goal setting = clarity = power.\n\nBUT, some ways are quicker, faster, and easier than others ... and a joy, not a chore.
