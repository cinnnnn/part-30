His fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business partner had looked after him in the years since his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. But Hugh WorthingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motives were not altruistic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he had a secret to hide and a scheme to bring to fruition that would make him millions at ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expense. ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roommate, Arthur Ferris, had his own schemes, including stealing the affections of WorthingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter away from Clayton. Clayton worked for a pittance in New York, where he was watched day and night by WorthingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spies, and by the ruthless Fritz Braun, who plotted to rob Clayton of the large deposit that he daily carried for his employer. It seemed that Jack Witherspoon was his only friend, the only one he could trust. But Jack was sailing for Europe and neither man fully comprehended the danger that was closing in on Randall.\n\nFrom: BitTorrentScene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a4c81a78a85572d24ea4420469e7c7600b5959","amp;dn":"The+Midnight+Passenger+by+Richard+Savage+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a4c81a78a85572d24ea4420469e7c7600b5959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,164,200,26,120,168,85,114,210,78,164,66,4,105,231,199,96,11,89,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
