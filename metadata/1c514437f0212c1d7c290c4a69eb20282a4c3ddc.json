Nothing Lasts (3:33)\n\nI remember hearing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the first time, way back in 1991. It was an undeniably strong pop song, with a chugging rhythm and a vocal hook that sounded like it came straight from the gods. But throughout the song, above that solid power-pop bedrock, someone was absolutely losing their mind on lead guitar. At its gentlest, that guitar simply bobbed and weaved and darted around, but when it reached critical mass, it sounded like someone was stretching a length of electrified barbed wire to the breaking point, only to let it go so it could backlash and whip around.\n\nThat someone turned out to be Robert Quine (also known for work with Richard Hell &amp; Voivoids, and Lou Reed, and who died in 2004), and as much as Girlfriend represents SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coming-out party, it also stands as one of QuineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shining moments. SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship with Quine and Richard Lloyd (Television) would define his sound for years; in top form, Quine and LloydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interplay was so sympathetic that it resembled nothing less than a needly, New Wave-informed version of the Rolling Stones.\n\nTo hear tales of GirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s birth, though, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a wonder the album ever saw the light of day. In 1991, Sweet was a largely unknown artist with poor record sales and an underdeveloped sound. Even after 1989ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Earth established SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fateful relationship with Quine and Lloyd, there was little indication that Sweet was brewing something like Girlfriend.\n\nBesides, alternative radio was only a blip on the radar at the time, so even after GirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s raucous mix of power-pop precision and frayed guitar emotion made it to tape, there werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t many buyers for what Sweet was offering. SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rules for creating the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no reverb, no effects, and no synthesizersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½probably didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help, since they further separated Girlfriend from the dominant sound of the time. Label after label rejected Girlfriend, and it was only after some in-house persistence and shenanigans on the part of some true believers at Zoo Records that the album got its chance.\n\nThen, to top things off, Sweet had to change the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original title, Nothing Lasts, when Tuesday WeldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s camp balked at allowing a vintage picture of Welds in her younger days to be used as cover art on an album with such a loaded name.\n\nSo after all that, Girlfriend hit the streets and took off, aided in no small part by a video that was many peoplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first exposure to anime. Now, 15 years later, the album doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sound a bit dated, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to believe that Sweet was ever anything but a fully-realized power-pop master.\n\nBut as anyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heard even a few aspiring power-pop bands can tell you, meticulous craftsmanship gets you only so far. Girlfriend, for all of SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growing talent, was also the product of major upheavals in SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life: a divorce and a subsequent new romance. You could argue that SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, harrowing though the personal turmoil must have been for Sweet himself, needed just such a kick in the pants. Prior to Girlfriend, Sweet was appropriately named, as his songs could rot your teeth. By contrast, Girlfriend bristled with excitement, confusion, and anger.\n\nIn that environment, GirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s guitar-heavy mix perfectly represented SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new direction. Songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Been WaitingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYour Sweet VoiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ reflected SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newfound optimism, while songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThought I Knew YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (in SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own words, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa song of bitterness and betrayalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Love MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalled the darkness of his heartbreak. Still others reflected the cloudy emotions in between. A few songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDivine InterventionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoly WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ allowed Sweet to address bigger issues, but the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bread and butter are the shadowlands at either end of relationships.\n\nThe first disc of this expanded anniversary edition basically gives us the Japanese version of Girlfriend, which sports three bonus tracks: demos of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood FriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which would become ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuperdeformedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which would show up in live form on the Son of Altered Beast EP; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTeenage FemaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a portrait of a needy fan.\n\nThe real draw, though, is Disc 2, which contains the much bootlegged Goodfriend promo that went out to DJs and other industry insiders upon GirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s release. A mixture of live tracks, acoustic demos, and BBC sessions, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always stood pretty well on its own. Two live versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGirlfriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ might seem like a bit much, but their stylistic differencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one flashing a burlesque shimmy while the other bristles with a ragged, punkish edgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½highlight SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fondness for pushing the edges of his own material. As a whole, the live tracks adopt a slight Crazy Horse vibe, a feeling thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s underscored even further by a version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCortez the KillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls guesting. The mixture of sources has always kept the Goodfriend disc from feeling like a mere blueprint for Girlfriend; rather, it often feels like an alternate version.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable how strong Girlfriend remains to this day, sounding like it could have come out yesterday. Along with its follow-up, 1993ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even stronger and darker Altered Beast, Girlfriend marked SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emergence as one of mainstream alternative rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more vibrant artists. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album that struck a chord on its release, and one that should have the same effect on any unsuspecting new listeners. Well worthy of the deluxe treatment.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/02/27/matthew-sweet/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c514437f0212c1d7c290c4a69eb20282a4c3ddc","amp;dn":"Matthew+Sweet...Girlfriend%281991%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c514437f0212c1d7c290c4a69eb20282a4c3ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,81,68,55,240,33,44,29,124,41,12,74,105,235,32,40,42,76,61,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
