It is also a political act highly frowned upon in materialistic societies because it removes one from obligate consumerism. And John Hoffman has written the ultimate guide for perfecting the art. A college graduate with a good job, Hoffman doesn't have to Dumpster dive: he loves to, and lives better--and more freely--because of it. In nations like America, there is an incredible amount of great stuff--often in great shape--thrown out every day. And Hoffman tells you how to claim it as your own.\n\nAt this point, I have a confession to make: I am a sometime Dumpster diver myself. Almost all of the furniture in our house has been found abandoned on the streets in our upper-middle-class neighborhood or nearby college campuses: sofas, tables, bookcases, lamps... you name it--even some of our several household computers! Personally, I wouldn't do some of what Hoffman advocates (such as diving for food), but as in the tradition of all Loompanics Press books, this is a no-holds-barred, tell-all book that assumes its readers can make decisions appropriate to their own lives. \n\nISBN-13: 978-1559500883\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Science-Dumpster-Diving-John-Hoffman/dp/1559500883&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Science-Dumpster-Diving-John-Hoffman/dp/1559500883&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ac96a248c94c22b6d886975152a95e9fdd9682","amp;dn":"The+Art+and+Science+of+Dumpster+Diving+by+John+Hoffman.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ac96a248c94c22b6d886975152a95e9fdd9682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,172,150,162,72,201,76,34,182,216,134,151,81,82,169,94,159,221,150,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
