Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nStories by one of the greatest living Irish writers.\n\ndescription:\n\nIn these selections from twenty years of her best short fiction, Edna O'Brien pulls the reader into a woman's experience. Her stories portray a young Irish girl's view of obsessive love and its often wrenching pain, while tales of contemporary life show women who open themselves to sexuality, to disappointment, to madness. Throughout, there is always O'Brien's voiceÃ‚â€” - wondrous, despairing, moving - Ã‚â€”examining passionate subjects that lay bare the desire and needs that can be hidden in a woman's heart.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8704c9cfc51555096466228bf66272a993c00c2","amp;dn":"Edna+O%27Brien+-+A+Fanatic+Heart%3A+Selected+Stories+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8704c9cfc51555096466228bf66272a993c00c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,112,76,156,252,81,85,80,150,70,98,40,191,102,39,42,153,60,0,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
