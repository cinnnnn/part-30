Kill It In The Morning (5:53)\n\nKilting Me Softly\nBy Eric Webb\n\nIndulge me, briefly. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a method to this self-confessional.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a little down lately. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve moved to a different state and back home again in less than a year. My new job is more difficult than I had imagined it would be; sometimes my hands get numb from stress. I work nights and weekends, so feelings of isolation abound. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m living at home for the first time in four years. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not as close to God as I would like to be. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in debt. Largely, luxurious problems to have. Waaah. In this post-grad cloud, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll excuse me if I need some brooding music while I wallow in narcissistic self-pity.\n\nIn a lackluster week for new releases, the Twilight Sad fit the bill.\n\nThink The Smiths. Think The Cure. Think Joy Division. This Scottish band is dark and ominous and buoyant and swelling in the tradition of some post-punk greats. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Can Ever Know,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third release, lives comfortably in that mournful corner of indie rock that Morrissey haunts.\n\nSo, while in a personal funk, with the problems of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early twenties seeming significant and great and terrible but being perhaps none of those things at all, the Twilight SadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passionate melancholy strikes a nerve. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Can Ever KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is never a dirge, always carried by an undercurrent of gravitas. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music for navel-gazing dramatics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“AlphabetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dead CityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ burst open the album from the beginning, until Ã¢â‚¬Å“SickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ turns the dial back a bit and the album settles into a slower burn of simmering menace, not unlike Silversun Pickups or some more downtempo Muse numbers. The air of danger carries through on Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Move,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is the sonic equivalent of a heroin needle, with its nervous, risky uneasiness. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nil,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the other hand, dispenses with unease and plummets into appropriate sounds of, well, nihilism.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Another Bed,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a tale of a lover gone away, takes Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Can Ever KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ back up into more energetic territory and joins Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Will Possess Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every Breath You TakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on my list of fun-obsessive-profoundly-creepy songs. As singer James Graham intones Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over and over again, you might look over your shoulder. Warning: This video is disturbing in a horror movie way. Not for the weak stomached.\n\nThe Twilight Sad is not merely a cheap Robert Smith imitation. Aesthetically, Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Can Ever KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ asserts the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own flavor as much as it draws on its influences. The Internet is full of references to the Twilight SadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“wall of soundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quality, and it is true that your ears get a great workout (though I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think Phil Spector would enjoy them too much). There is no Ã¢â‚¬Å“backingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instrumentation on this album Ã¢â‚¬â€ every sound pulls its weight in a musical onslaught at the foreground, though the liberal use of industrial noise does stand out.\n\nWhat really makes the Twilight Sad special, however, is GrahamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice. His Scottish brogue is impenetrable at times, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the engine that drives this album. A weaker vocalist would get lost in the dark, jagged alleyways of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs, but GrahamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aggressive, muscular voice carries the threatening sound deftly. At times, a hint of hardcore lingers in his braying.\n\nThere are times in your life when you do not want to lift yourself out of your petty doldrums, when sunny pop-punk grates and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve exhausted your tolerance for synths. I want to feel sad sometimes, so that I can get the sad out and make room for being grateful and content. Every now and then, you need a Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Can Ever Know.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ee2c8b43c1599e9c645f8614337fc1fcadf312","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Sad+-+No+One+Can+Ever+Know+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ee2c8b43c1599e9c645f8614337fc1fcadf312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,238,44,139,67,193,89,158,156,100,95,134,20,51,127,193,252,173,243,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
