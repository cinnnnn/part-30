Similar to the rapper's previous albums, it was a commercial hit, debuting at #5 on the Billboard 200 with 215,000 copies sold in its first week.[9] However, it was heavily criticized for what many saw as Cube's pandering to gangsta rap, and toning down of the socio-political content found on his earlier efforts. The album's standing has increased over time. It includes the popular singles; &quot;You Know How We Do It&quot;, and the Funkadelic-sampling &quot;Bop Gun (One Nation)&quot;, which became a staple on MTV.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tProducer(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;The Shot&quot; (Intro)\tSir Jinx\t0:55\n2.\t&quot;Really Doe&quot;  \tDerrick McDowell, Lay Law\t4:28\n3.\t&quot;Ghetto Bird&quot;  \tQDIII\t3:50\n4.\t&quot;You Know How We Do It&quot;  \tQDIII\t3:52\n5.\t&quot;Cave Bitch&quot;  \tBrian G\t4:18\n6.\t&quot;Bop Gun (One Nation)&quot; (featuring George Clinton)\tIce Cube, QDIII\t11:17\n7.\t&quot;What Can I Do?&quot;  \t88 X Unit\t4:39\n8.\t&quot;Lil Ass Gee&quot;  \tSir Jinx\t4:04\n9.\t&quot;Make It Ruff, Make It Smooth&quot; (featuring K-Dee)\tQDIII\t4:23\n10.\t&quot;Down For Whatever&quot;  \tMadness 4 Real\t4:40\n11.\t&quot;Enemy&quot;  \tMadness 4 Real\t4:50\n12.\t&quot;When I Go to Heaven&quot;  \tBrian G\t5:04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37aa21c4991ef4fce38119a7cc211824d4a9d02","amp;dn":"Ice+Cube+-+Lethal+Injection+%281993%29+-+%28CDrip%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37aa21c4991ef4fce38119a7cc211824d4a9d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,122,162,28,73,145,239,79,206,56,17,154,124,194,17,130,77,74,157,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
