On Twitter, word can spread faster than wildfire. Companies no longer have the option of ignoring the conversation.\n\nUnlike other hot social media spaces, Twitterville is dominated by professionals, not students. And despite its size, it still feels like a small town. Twitter allows people to interact much the way they do face-to-face, honestly and authentically. One minute, you're com- plaining about the weather with local friends, the next, you're talking shop with a colleague based halfway across the globe.\n\nNo matter where you're from or what you do for a living, you will find conversations on Twitter that are valuable. Despite the millions of people joining the site, you'll quickly find the ones who can make a difference to you.\n\nSocial media writer Shel Israel shares revealing stories of Twitterville residents, from CEOs to the student who became the first to report the devastation of the Szechuan earthquake; from visionaries trying to raise money for a cause to citizen journalists who outshine traditional media companies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447443d7e49f4b0c3b1839d0e561172f7a07994b","amp;dn":"Twitterville%3A+How+BusinessesThrive+in+the+Global+Neighborhoods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447443d7e49f4b0c3b1839d0e561172f7a07994b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,116,67,215,228,159,75,12,59,24,57,208,229,97,23,47,122,7,153,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
