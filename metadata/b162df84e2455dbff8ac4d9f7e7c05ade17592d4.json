Translate this to whatever language you use, or install it anyway. You'll only see the Swedish line if you ever want to add or remove protocols again.\n\nDriver version: 07/01/2001,5.1.2600.3029\nrspndr.sys, rspndr.exe and rspndr.inf are all official files from Microsoft.\n\nThe lltd.bat is a batchfile I wrote myself. It copies the files to the correct windows folders, change current folder and installs the protocol. Nothing else. The command lines inside:\n\n   copy rspndr.exe %windir%System32\n   copy rspndr.sys %windir%System32Drivers\n   copy rspndr.inf %windir%Inf\n   cd %windir%system32\n   rspndr.exe -i\n\nI've used this on many XP computers, and also on my windows home server (2k3). Works great!\nThe only thing to remember is, you have to have this folder on a drive with a drive letter. You can't run this directly from a network share unless the mounted as a drive.\n\nIf you copy the files to a folder on your desktop, you can safely remove that folder after the batch is completed (takes just a few seconds).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b162df84e2455dbff8ac4d9f7e7c05ade17592d4","amp;dn":"LLTD+Batch+%28Link-Layer+Topology+Responder+Driver%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b162df84e2455dbff8ac4d9f7e7c05ade17592d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,98,223,132,226,69,93,191,248,172,77,159,126,124,5,173,225,117,146,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
