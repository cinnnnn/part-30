We would be bragging, of course.'' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Biologist Lewis Thomas, on what message to send to an extraterrestrial civilization\n\nUnderappreciated in his own time, Johann Sebastian Bach has ascended to Olympian heights in the estimation of generations of music lovers.\n\nBut what is it about his music that makes it great? Composer and musicologist Robert Greenberg helps you hear the extraordinary sweep of Bach's music and understand his compositional languageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whether you're a devoted admirer or a casual listener.\n\nHow Did Bach Become Bach?\n\nProfessor Greenberg sets Bach in context by tracing the musical traditions and composers from whom he drew his inspiration, and explaining how Bach absorbed these influences to become the transcendent composer of the High Baroque. According to Professor Greenberg, no other composer is more representative of the period and its aesthetic of emotional extravagance and technical control.\n\nYou will also learn how Bach's backgroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at least 42 of his relatives were professionally involved with musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and his strong German Lutheran heritage shaped his development as an artist. \n\n\n32 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb404bb0803c12139a7131056431615506b761e","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Bach+And+The+High+Baroque","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb404bb0803c12139a7131056431615506b761e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,180,4,187,8,3,193,33,57,167,19,16,86,67,22,21,80,107,118,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
