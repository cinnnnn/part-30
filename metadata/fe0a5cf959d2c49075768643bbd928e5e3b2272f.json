A choice gathering of some of the twentieth century's greatest poetry... read by the century's greatest poets.\n\nA reawakened love for the sound of poetry has made modern poems subtly different from the poems of the eighteenth and nineteenth centures. We have only to listen to these poets reading their own works to know how important their interpretations are to a full comprehension of their poems. The ministerial intonations of Eliot, the passionate orchestrations of Thomas, the very very precise formulations of Cummings, the easy conversational inflection of Frost are integral, lending subtle clarifications which go beyond the printed page.\n\nThe fact that this recording includes the voice of Yeats is something of a miracle. In the early 1930's, when the thought of recording poets occurred to few, Yeats himself made several recordings for radio broadcast. By sheer luck, an unmutilated copy was preserved; and now the rich and melodious voice can be heard by a new generation.\n\nThis Collection eliminates the struggle for perfect communication between author and reader. Just listen and you'll understand... \n\nTake, enjoy, and please... seed... so that others can enjoy!\n\nContents:\n\nCD 1: \n\nWilliam Butler Yeats \nThe Song of the Old Mother\nThe Lake Isle of Innisfree\n\nW.H.
