On being asked his name, Abbas's friend comes out with a fake name 'Abhishek Bachchan',\nas it would create a rage if villagers came to know that the lock of a temple had been\nbroken by a Muslim. From here starts a series of cover-ups, goof-ups and comic situations where to cover one\nlie, Abbas starts padding up with a bigger lie telling people that he also has a twin brother with\nno moustache. From here on starts the topsy-turvy journey of a single person acting as two different entities.\nPrithviraj is made to believe that Abbas is a gay. So he appoints Abbas as a kathak dance teacher\nto his sister Radhika (Prachi Desai). This makes Abbas to work as supervisor as Abishek Bachchan at morning and kathak\nteacher to Radhika at night as Abbas. Soon, Radhika and Abbas fall in love. In the climax, Prithviraj\ncomes to know the truth, but he likes Abbas's character and spares them.\nGenre:Foreign | Comedy\nRelease date:06-07-2012\n\nActors\n\nAjay Devgn ...
