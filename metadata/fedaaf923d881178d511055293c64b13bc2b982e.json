The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. The authors conclude by illustrating the opportunity cost of the resources spent on waging the war. The book was a New York Times and international best-seller and has been translated into 22 languages.\n\nThe video for the Carnegie Endowment for peace where he discussed this: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://carnegieendowment.org/2013/03/21/trillion-dollar-war-and-counting/fsl6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://carnegieendowment.org/2013/03/21/trillion-dollar-war-and-counting/fsl6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTranscript of the video added as a bonus\n\nZip file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fedaaf923d881178d511055293c64b13bc2b982e","amp;dn":"The+Three+Trillion+Dollar+War+-+Joseph+Stiglitz+%7BIncludes+transc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fedaaf923d881178d511055293c64b13bc2b982e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,218,175,146,61,136,17,120,213,17,5,82,147,198,75,19,188,43,152,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
