Relying on extensive research based heavily on original Russian sources, this definitive biography depicts an incredibly complex man living in a time of simple, harsh realities. Robert Payne, the distinguished author of many historical and biographical works, and Russian scholar Nikita Romanoff, describe in vivid and lively detail Ivan's callous upbringing; the poisoning of his second wife and the murder of his son; his obsession with religion and sin; his predilection for mass murder, evidenced by his massacre of 30,000 citizens of Novgorod; yet his remarkable intelligence as a ruler, supporting the growth of trade and expanding Russia's borders. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f87e9d39cdd7bd7dbd8485274a5b56ab05624c","amp;dn":"Ivan+the+Terrible+by+Robert+Payne%2C+Nikita+Romanoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f87e9d39cdd7bd7dbd8485274a5b56ab05624c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,248,126,157,57,205,215,189,125,189,132,133,39,74,91,86,171,5,98,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
