All of his efforts are phenomenal. Oh yeah this is smokin\\'! \n\nThe Conrad Herwig Sextet: Conrad Herwig (trombone); Seamus Blake (tenor saxophone); Alexander Sipiagin (trumpet); David Kikoski (piano); James Genus (bass); Jeff \\&quot;Tain\\&quot; Watts (drums).\n\nEven if you are new to jazz this is a great place to start. If you like this guy or the others on this recording...support them. Buy their music and treat yourself and attend their shows.\n\nConrad has two new recordings...The Latin Side of Herbie Hancock and The Latin Side of Wayne Shorter. They both are awesome (pick them up..you will not regret it)! \n\nThis recording is not out of print, but this artist is deserving of more recognition! This is why I selected him and this particular recording. Enjoy.\n\n\n1. The Tesseract 6:32\n2. From Another Dimension 8:28\n3. Unseen Universe 8:36\n4. Triangle 9:15\n5. All Is One 8:10\n6. Rebirth 5:16\n7. Circumstantially Evident 6:16\n8. The Magic Door 7:37\n9. Three Degrees Of Freedom 7:45\n\n\nEnjoy from Cumin aka Enja2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecaa2f7c552ff1af1ca44c781e3eb85b1d1f4f6","amp;dn":"Conrad+Herwig+Sextet+Unseen+Universe++%5BFlac%5D+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecaa2f7c552ff1af1ca44c781e3eb85b1d1f4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,202,162,247,197,82,255,26,241,202,68,199,129,227,235,133,177,209,244,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
