Though he was apparently killed in the summer, he re-appears in extremely cold snow, nearly dies again by freezing, and is saved by a fur-clad woman named Diana. The exact circumstances of his being killed and reborn after a century and half are never explained.\n\nThe later 21st Century people seem strangely incurious, showing little interest in how he had come to be among them and rather take his appearance for granted and proceed to explain to him the details of the social and political set-up of their world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde5921b77b061e72044ee1c7e7e36677ef7d5a9","amp;dn":"For+Us%2C+the+Living","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde5921b77b061e72044ee1c7e7e36677ef7d5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,229,146,27,119,176,97,231,32,68,238,28,126,126,54,103,126,247,213,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
