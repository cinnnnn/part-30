The band's first period of success in the 1990s was phenomenal but unsustainable. Now, 20 years after it all began, Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams turn to face that past and share their truth collectively. With unrestricted and privileged access to the recording studio throughout the last 12 months, the programme is a raw, intimate meditation on the process of friendship and forgiveness.\n\nThe programme is filmed in black and white cinema style 2.35 aspect ratio format.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 7000 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1904x820\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.322:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: 66 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 3.31 GB\nSubtitles: none\nSource: DVB-S (ITV HD)\n\nXvid also available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494441884a00180201c667c3159dc1fe0fe0e168","amp;dn":"ITV+Take+That+Look+Back+Don%5C%27t+Stare+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494441884a00180201c667c3159dc1fe0fe0e168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,68,65,136,74,0,24,2,1,198,103,195,21,157,193,254,15,224,225,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
