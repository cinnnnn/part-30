Now Darren, the vampire's assistant, gets a taste of the city when he leaves the Cirque Du Freak with Evra and Mr. Crepsley -- but so, it seems, does something else. When corpses are discovered -- corpses drained of blood -- Darren and Evra are compelled to confront a foul creature of the night, who may prove to be the end of them all. Beneath the streets, evil stalks Darren and his friends. Can they escape, or are they doomed to perish in the tunnels of blood? The gut-wrenching sequel to the New York Times bestseller Cirque Du Freak and The Vampire's Assistant, Tunnels of Blood continues the saga of Darren Shan. Filled with grotesque creatures, murderous vampires, and an unexpected ending, Tunnels of Blood will chill, thrill, and leave readers begging for more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a57cbe5ad326085eb0d1cf861e899a39cdd97a21","amp;dn":"03+Tunnels+of+Blood+-+Darren+Shan-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a57cbe5ad326085eb0d1cf861e899a39cdd97a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,124,190,90,211,38,8,94,176,209,207,134,30,137,154,57,205,217,122,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
