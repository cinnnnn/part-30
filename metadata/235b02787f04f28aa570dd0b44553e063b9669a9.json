Yellow Ledbetter\n\n\n\nVocalist Eddie Vedder, basically being a man of very few words, tends to get your attention when \nhe does speak above a mumble. And when he tells the crowd in Verona that, because it's been so \nlong since Pearl Jam played there, they are going to play a longer set, you can bet he's not \nkidding. Heck, the 12-song encore, which includes &quot;Black,&quot; &quot;Evolution,&quot; &quot;Better Man,&quot; &quot;Alive,&quot; \nand &quot;Porch,&quot; would have been worth the price of admission alone. The 19-song set that precedes \nis certainly no disappointment, either. Sure, there are a few out-of-tune moments early on in \n&quot;Hail Hail&quot; and &quot;Animal,&quot; but that's part of the magic of these discs. There's not a Pearl Jam \nCD unrepresented in this amazing performance, as well as a few rarities, such as a snippet of \nTom Waits's &quot;In the Coliseum&quot; and the very raw and unrehearsed but utterly sweet version of \n&quot;I Got You,&quot; which the band sort of stumbles through. It's shows like this that truly capture \nthe spirit of this &quot;bootleg&quot; series, capturing the spontaneity of a set (or songs) that may \nnever be played the same way again. --Adem Tepedelen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235b02787f04f28aa570dd0b44553e063b9669a9","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+2000-06-20+-+Arena+Di+Verona+in+Verona+Italy+++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235b02787f04f28aa570dd0b44553e063b9669a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,91,2,120,127,4,242,138,165,112,221,11,68,85,62,6,59,150,105,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
