A multi-layered level design across eight different tracks, together with a procedural endless mode make for a game that is incredibly deep. Think you can outrun your friends? Try the split-screen versus challenges.\n\nThe visuals are a treat for the nostalgic player but also for those hungry for new aesthetics. Every pixel is drawn to convey the maximum sense of speed, an exhilarating journey through light and void.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 8 Levels to explore and master.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Plus 3 different endless levels to compete for high-scores.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Two-player split-screen multiplayer mode on the same device!\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 18 Achievements to unlock plus game stats.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Online rankings.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Beautiful, smooth, and unique vector-style graphics.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Electronic music by Michael Manning, NicolÃƒÂ² Sala, and legendary composer Baiyon.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 2 Difficulty settings to let you play an even faster version of FOTONICA.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Play in landscape or portrait mode.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ No ads, no in-app purchases.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Record and share replays of your best runs.\n\n-OTHER REVIEWS-\nPOCKET GAMER Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“As good as competitive, hold-your-breath-every-second, first-person racing getsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nChris Priestman, pocketgamer.co.uk\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“EUROGAMER Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8/10 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Usain Bolt trapped in a feverish Tron daydreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nKristan Reed, eurogamer.net Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“GAMEPRO Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5/5 Ã¢â‚¬Å“This one button game has a lot more mileage than you might expectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNathan Meunier, gamepro.com Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“THE CREATORS PROJECT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“A veritable black hole to lose yourself inÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nEmerson Rosenthal, thecreatorsproject.com Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ARS TECHNICA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Striking and instantly impressiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nBen Kuchera, arstechnica.comÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ROCK, PAPER, SHOTGUN Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a remarkable game, and unlike anything else IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve playedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nJohn Walker, rockpapershotgun.com Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-AWARDS-\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fantastic Arcade Spotlight Game 2014Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“EuroGamer Expo SelectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“54th Biennale of Art in Venice SelectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n \n\nAdditional information\nUpdated\nMarch 23, 2015\nSize\n97M\nInstalls\n5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10\nCurrent Version\n1.1.6\nRequires Android\n4.0 and up\nContent Rating\nEveryonehttps://lh5.ggpht.com/AYIc0E8kBqIDBIOK4emXHvbVvsBm028T5KY5TZGRp_WO-1E1vEzsXrdyxZkS3k2AnLE=h400","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c42a18ff9aa8aae42b086fd84a0bf90391d74cd","amp;dn":"FOTONICA+v1.16++Apk%2BObb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c42a18ff9aa8aae42b086fd84a0bf90391d74cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,66,161,143,249,170,138,174,66,176,134,253,132,160,191,144,57,29,116,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
