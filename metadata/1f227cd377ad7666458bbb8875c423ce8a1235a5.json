At just 1 minute and 15 seconds the song was intended as a short instrumental interlude between the tracks &quot;Holy&quot; and &quot;High&quot;. However, &quot;Flute of Krishna&quot; soon started to get a life outside the context of the EP. The track became popular as music for meditation, and people started asking why on earth the song was so short. The original recording of the song had in fact been a 10 minute long piece of contemporary classical minimalism, but the recording was cut down drastically for the Agni EP. Making a longer version was thus simple enough, the difficult part was finding a place for it. Wukimon eventually decided to release the extended version of &quot;Flute of Krishna&quot; on its own, as an online single. The track was released on Mininova together with the track &quot;The Bells&quot;.
