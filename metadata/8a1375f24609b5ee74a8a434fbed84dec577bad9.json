A program that gives you the opportunity to play with physics - using your own hands. Apply a constructionists learning paradigm, learning by doing. Use simple drawing tools to design, construct and explore with. Sounds like an interesting idea? We believe Algodoo is that program. \n\nWith simple functionality you can draw and interact with physical systems on your computer.\n\nBuild and explore with rigid bodies, fluids, chains, gears, gravity, friction, springs, hinges, etc. Interact by click and drag, tilt and shake. Use color traces, graphs, forces, etc. for enhanced visualization\n\nAlgodoo for Education is deeply integrated and optimized for SMART Boards with multi-touch features. Together they make a unique combo for teaching and learning science in the classroom allowing multi-user drawing, interaction and editing. But Algodoo is also good match for any other IWT platform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1375f24609b5ee74a8a434fbed84dec577bad9","amp;dn":"Algodoo+%28For+Education%29+2.0.0-AmULet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1375f24609b5ee74a8a434fbed84dec577bad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,19,117,242,70,9,181,238,116,168,164,52,251,237,132,222,197,119,186,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
