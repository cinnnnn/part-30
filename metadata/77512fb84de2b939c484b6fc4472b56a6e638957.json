Greatly influenced by punk and new wave's reckless aggression, as well as power-pop's love of memorable hooks, Fastball is a band that rocks intensely but isn't without a strong melodic sense. A variety of comparisons can be made -- everyone from the Knack, Elvis Costello and Generation X to the Beatles -- but freewheeling numbers like &quot;Knock It Down,&quot; &quot;Human Torch&quot; and &quot;Back Door&quot; show that these natives of Austin, Texas have an appealing energy of their own. At times, Fastball combines punk-ish sensibilities with early- to mid-1960s touches, two examples being &quot;Are You Ready for the Fallout&quot; and &quot;Altamont.&quot; For those who like their power-pop with lots of bite, Make Your Mama Proud merits close attention.
