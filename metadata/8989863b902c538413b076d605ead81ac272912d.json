The county sheriff (Nestor Paiva) tentatively \nidentifies the dead man as Eric Jacobs, a laboratory assistant to Professor \nDeemer (Leo G. Carroll), a research scientist living a few miles out in the \ndesert. But there&amp;#039;s something strange about Jacobs; his facial features and \nbodily extremities are distorted to a point where he&amp;#039;s barely recognizable. The \nsheriff calls in Dr. Matt Hastings (John Agar), the local physician, who makes a \ndiagnosis of acromegalia, a glandular disorder that affects the body&amp;#039;s growth. \nHe also tells the sheriff that it can&amp;#039;t possibly be acromegalia, because \nsymptoms as pronounced as those he sees in this case take years to develop, and \nthe man was in perfect health just three months earlier. Hastings refuses to \nbelieve the professor&amp;#039;s account of Jacobs&amp;#039; rapid deterioration, but the sheriff \ntakes the word of the scientist. Back in his laboratory, Deemer continues his \nwork, going over tests of a chemical on various animals, all of which are \njumbo-sized, including guinea pigs the size of rabbits, baby mice the size of \nfull-grown rats, and a tarantula three feet long. Suddenly, the professor is \nattacked by his assistant (Eddie Parker), whose face and hands are distorted in \nthe same manner as Jacobs, and who injects the helpless scientist with the \nexperimental chemical before collapsing dead. A fire starts during the attack \nand in the confusion, the tarantula&amp;#039;s glass cage is broken and it escapes the \nburning laboratory, wandering out into the desert. Weeks go by, and a new \nassistant, Stephanie &quot;Steve&quot; Clayton (Mara Corday), arrives to begin work for \nthe professor. When Hastings gives her a ride to Deemer&amp;#039;s home, the scientist \nexplains to the doctor that he&amp;#039;s been working on a radioactive nutrient, that, \nif perfected, could feed the entire world&amp;#039;s population. He also says that Eric \nJacobs made the mistake of testing the chemical on himself and it caused the \ndisease that killed him. Hastings and Steve begin a romance, unaware that \nwandering around the desert is the tarantula from Deemer&amp;#039;s laboratory, now grown \nto the size of an automobile and getting bigger with each passing day. Soon \nlivestock and then people begin disappearing, and the sheriff is at a loss to \nexplain any of it, or the one clue left behind in each case: large pools of what \nseems to be some kind of venom next to the stripped skeletons of the victims. \nHastings takes some of the material in for a test; meanwhile, Steve notices that \nDeemer is going through some bizarre changes. His mood has darkened and his \nfeatures now appear to be changing, as the acromegalia, caused by the injection, \nmanifests itself. Hastings learns that one of the professor&amp;#039;s test animals was a \ntarantula, which was presumed destroyed. When he learns that the pools near the \ndeaths are composed of spider venom -- equivalent to what it would take many \nthousands of spiders to generate -- he&amp;#039;s certain that the tarantula from the \nlaboratory survived. By this time, the title creature is bigger than a house and \nravaging the countryside, killing everything in its path and knocking down power \nlines and telephone poles as it moves. Hastings arrives just in time to rescue \nSteve from the attacking creature, which destroys Deemer&amp;#039;s house and kills the \nprofessor. The sheriff and the highway patrol are unable to slow the creature, \nnow the size of a mountain and moving at 45 miles an hour, even with automatic \nrifle fire, as it follows the road through the desert toward the town. Even an \nattempt to blow it up with dynamite fails when the monster walking right through \nthe blast. Finally, the creature is poised to attack the town, when jets \nscrambled from a nearby Air Force base (led by a young Clint Eastwood, barely \nrecognizable behind an oxygen mask) swoop in. When rockets fail to divert the \nmonster from its path, the jets roar in for a second pass and drop enough napalm \nto incinerate the creature.\n\nCAST\nJohn Agar              - Dr. Matt Hastings\nMara Corday            - Stephanie &quot;Steve&quot; Clayton\nLeo G.

Croce\n\n&quot;The desert gives people wonderful ideas,&quot; it is said here. Jack Arnold seizes \nit with his first image, a lateral scan of the Arizona prairie that catches a \nfurry mutant stumbling about in striped pajamas and dropping dead. The nature of \nthe corpse befuddles doctor John Agar and sheriff Nestor Paiva, but the local \nscientist (Leo G. Carroll) assures them there&amp;#039;s nothing out of the ordinary \nbefore retiring to his lab, which houses a rodent the size of a tapir and a \ntarantula quickly growing &quot;hundreds, even thousands of times its regular size.&quot; \nA scuffle gets Carroll injected with his own &quot;concentrated nutrient&quot; serum \n(which leads to expressionistic makeup) and frees the arachnid, which proceeds \nto brunch on cattle and farmers. Curiosity and dread exist side by side in \nArnold&amp;#039;s view of the unknown, the arid landscape admired by Agar and Mara Corday \n(&quot;serene, quiet... strangely evil&quot;) is tranquil one moment and quaked by \nboulders the next. The director is a Cold War surrealist with an endless \nfascination for the strangeness of the cosmos and, like Walt Whitman and \nCronenberg, an easeful appreciation for the image of the poet as spider -- the \nfearsome colossus here is an eight-legged King Kong, imbued with a seismic \nrattle and a lion&amp;#039;s roar, emerging unscathed from a dynamite blast to creep \ntoward the camera. The dreamlike effects have the tarantula dismantling an \nedifice to claim its creator and then facing a napalm blitzkrieg (led by a young \nClint Eastwood), but Arnold sees nature as no less beguiling than artifice, and \nincludes a couple of choice documentary minutes of a spider defending its home \nagainst a marauding serpent, all &quot;part of the world around us.&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy Jenn Dlugos, 2004-10-01\n\nTarantula was one of UniversalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first &quot;giant-animal-type-monster wreaks havock \non helpless civilians&quot; movie. The times of the more humanistic monsters, like \nFrankenstein and Dracula, have passed and now bigger = better. As far as mutant \nmonsters go, Tarantula is one of the most solid films ever created.\n\nProfessor Gerald Deemer (played by the brilliant Leo G. Carroll. *bursts into \nsong* Leo G Carroll was over a barrel, when Tarantula took to the hill... er... \nsorry) is a typical mad scientist who is working on a formula to end world \nhunger. Mainly, he is injecting animals with this serum that make them larger. \nFor some reason, his lab is full of animals most humans would not eat despite \nfamishment, such as rats and oh, say, giant tarantulas. But whatever. The \ntarantula escapes and gets exponentially larger. This is complicated by the fact \nthat Professor Deemer has injected himself with the serum (the first Viagra, \napparently) and only has several days to live. So, like all monster movies, it \nis up to some hot guy and some beautiful chick to save the day.\n\nAtomic creatures were all the rage in this period because science was just \nunderstanding the capability of the atom (atomic bombs, etc.). Today, most of \nthese monster movies seem dated, but Tarantula still seems to hold up. This is \nprobably due to the fact that we are still battling many of these issues today \n(i.e. world hunger, and when I leave my aquarium cage unlocked - giant \ntarantulas on the loose). Not to mention, everything came to a frightful \nconclusion that involved nukes which is surely a modern day issue. And hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a \nlittle trivia point for the rest of you. Look very closely at the pilot of the \nplane in the climax. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s none other, than a very young Clint Eastwood.\n\nI can see how this movie was considered absolutely terrifying in its time. For a \n1950s film, the special effects were excellent. Sure, there were some blatant \nuse of movie screens, but some shots -- especially when the giant spider is off \nin the distance -- are absolutely chilling. Even for me, a person who has \ntarantulas as pets, the film was downright eerie. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t imagine what it would \nbe like for someone who is terrified or even apprehensive of all things \narachnid. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m pretty sure some of my friends would slip into terror-induced \ncomas.\n\nSpecial effects alone do not make terror; there are many lesser giant spider \nfilms. The plot of Tarantula is what sold me. I always gives a thumbs up for \ncreativity, and inflating animals in an attempt to stop world hunger is \nsomething I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think of. And I have all sorts of strange things going on \nin my head (shut up, Nate). Sure the tarantulas were a bit of a stretch, but \ntarantulas are a delicacy in some countries (pauses for readers to cringe. \nBetter? ProceedingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦). Tarantula has a trio of storylines that dovetail nicely \ninto each other. The giant tarantula on the loose was the primary story, but \nProf Gerald DeemerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s struggle with his science, and the two main heroesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \nstruggle with their love for each other braided together into a film that was \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmore than your typical monster movie.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ This film had heart and soul as well as \nscares which is what made it a step above the rest.\n\nTarantula is a staple in the classic horror community and a movie you absolutely \nshould have seen by now. It is monster movie cinema at its absolute finest. It \nhas its share of comic relief (keep an evil eye out for the tarantula training \nvideo in the middle of the movie -a personal favorite arbitrary piece of \ncelluloid). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially fun to watch with someone is an arachnaphobe. \nEspecially if they do not know that you have no qualms about holding your pet \ntarantula at all.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
