HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the story of Elvis PresleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first Sun records that inspired all. And hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and many more rockabillies from the golden years of 1955Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1959, in a book chock full of photos, collectible memorabilia, movie posters, rare records, fashion, and rebel lifestyle. Includes contributions from noted music journalists Greil Marcus, Peter Guralnick, Luc Sante, Robert Gordon, and more.\n\nThe story continues today, with a rockabilly revival that began with stars, such as the Stray Cats and Robert Gordon, spreading around the globe from Europe to Japan. Today, rockabilly is better than ever, with bands like Rev. Horton Heat and others playing the music and living the life from Memphis to Helsinki to Tokyo. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still good rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tonight!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9520d2376bd5328830860d50de054b7c4278964a","amp;dn":"Rockabilly+-+The+Illustrated+History+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9520d2376bd5328830860d50de054b7c4278964a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,32,210,55,107,213,50,136,48,134,13,80,222,5,75,124,66,120,150,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
