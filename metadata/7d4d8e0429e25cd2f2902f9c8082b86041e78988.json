For After Life, John and a documentary crew traveled to Australia and across the United States, where he demonstrated once again that grief, healing, and hope are eternally intertwined. He answers his fans' most-asked questions about the mediumship process and how it works, while revealing his own personal life as a husband and new father. Edward also shares what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned through his own personal losses and demonstrates that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never too late to forgiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and never too far away to love.\nJohn also connects with celebrities both here and on the other side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4d8e0429e25cd2f2902f9c8082b86041e78988","amp;dn":"After+Life%3A+Answers+from+the+Other+Side","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4d8e0429e25cd2f2902f9c8082b86041e78988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,77,142,4,41,226,92,210,242,144,47,156,128,130,184,96,65,231,137,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
