Prior to this the world was a brighter, more hopeful place. Superheroes are only remembered as vaguely as fiction (as they are in the real world), and behind the scenes a cabal of the leading super-villains runs the entire world.\n\n\n\nThe series is adult in nature, similar to more grown-up &amp;#039;super-hero&amp;#039; titles such as The Authority or The Ultimates. Like the Authority or the Squadron Supreme, several characters are based on DC Comics characters and super-villains (See below). Critics agree with Kiralee in that the series also bears resemblance to the 1999 films Fight Club and the The Matrix, as it is about a despondent man in an unfulfilling white-collar life who attempts to change himself, but becomes extremely violent and marked as outside of &amp;#039;normal&amp;#039; society. It differs from these stories in that the main character has no desire to improve the world through this violence, but only embraces it in the pursuit of an escape from his previous life and selfish and egocentric pleasures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbec07946f6f3a88d467dc6bafb4714e1109586c","amp;dn":"Wanted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbec07946f6f3a88d467dc6bafb4714e1109586c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,236,7,148,111,111,58,136,212,103,220,107,175,180,113,78,17,9,88,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
