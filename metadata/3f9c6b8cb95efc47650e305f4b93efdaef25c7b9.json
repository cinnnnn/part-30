They've watched each others' backs since they could stand, and those bonds are tested daily as they navigate a city where loyalty usually only runs as deep as one's bank account. Val and Cassie take the most dangerous jobs, and watch as others bask in the glory. But now, as their former mentor becomes L.A.'s most wanted fugitive, Val and Cassie will fight through L.A.'s glitziest and grimiest hoods as they learn just what sacrifices are necessary to make Hollywood dreams come true.\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - Powers (#1-84) (Image) (Brian Michael Bendis):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8827729&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8827729&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9c6b8cb95efc47650e305f4b93efdaef25c7b9","amp;dn":"Freelancers+%28%231-6%29+%28Boom%21+Studios%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9c6b8cb95efc47650e305f4b93efdaef25c7b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,156,107,140,185,94,252,71,101,14,48,95,75,147,239,218,239,37,199,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
