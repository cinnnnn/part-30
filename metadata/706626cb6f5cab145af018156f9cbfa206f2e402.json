Read by horror icon Doug Bradley with music and sound design by Alistair Lock.\nThis volume features William F Harvey's original undead hand story The Beast with Five Fingers that sparked many movies including Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead. Poe's classic The Tell Tale Heart is joined by Lovecraft's creepy tale of alienation The Outsider, and a chilling Dickens ghost story The Signalman. Harvey's other selected story, August Heat, asks a chilling question about a man's fate, and Saki offers something different with a tale of dead hunters returned from their marshy graves in The Open Window.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706626cb6f5cab145af018156f9cbfa206f2e402","amp;dn":"Doug+Bradley%5C%27s+Spine+Chillers+Vol+1+m4b+aac+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706626cb6f5cab145af018156f9cbfa206f2e402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,102,38,203,111,92,171,20,90,240,24,21,111,156,191,162,6,242,228,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
