Mr. Nussbaum can be surprisingly heavy on this recording..watch out! This is one of my favorite recordings by this power house reed man. Oh forgot to mention that Mr. Hino makes sure you remember he was on this album.\n\nThis pressing is from the Impulse catalogue, but I believe it was originally marketed on Timeless Records.\n\nMr. Liebman is still performing. If you like his music seek out: 1) Mosaic Select: David Liebman &amp; Richie Beirach by Liebman and Beirach. 2) Quest II by Quest or 3) Abracadabra by Jeff Palmer, David Liebman, John Abercrombie and Adam Nussbaum. These recordings are much different from what you have here but all are worth owning. \n\nRemember support the artist. See them in concert and purchase their music!!!\n\n1 If They Only Knew\n2 Capistano \n3 Moontide \n4 Reunion \n5 Autumn In New York \n6 Move On Some \n\n\nBass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ron McClure\nDrums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Adam Nussbaum\nGuitar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ John Scofield\nTenor Saxophone, Soprano Saxophone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ David Liebman\nTrumpet, Flugelhorn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Terumasa Hino\n\nEnjoy from Cumin aka Enja2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8129268d628f93ad82a3a10ec6cd8143f8c637","amp;dn":"David+Liebman+If+They+Only+Knew+%5BFlac%5D+%5BJazz%5D+Cumin+aka+Enja2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8129268d628f93ad82a3a10ec6cd8143f8c637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,129,41,38,141,98,143,147,173,130,163,161,14,198,205,129,67,248,198,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
