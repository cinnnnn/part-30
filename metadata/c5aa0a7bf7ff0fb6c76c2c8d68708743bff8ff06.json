Allison reaches out for help through her blog, writing on her laptop and utilizing the military's emergency wireless network (SNET). It may also be her only chance to reach her mother. But as the reality of their situation sinks in, Allison's blog becomes a harrowing account of her edge-of-the-seat adventures (with some witty sarcasm thrown in) as she and her companions fight their way through ravenous zombies and sometimes even more dangerous humans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5aa0a7bf7ff0fb6c76c2c8d68708743bff8ff06","amp;dn":"Allison+Hewitt+Is+Trapped+-++Madeleine+Roux.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5aa0a7bf7ff0fb6c76c2c8d68708743bff8ff06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,170,10,123,247,255,15,182,199,108,44,141,104,112,135,67,191,248,255,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
