The pair went on to make nine more films together. Perhaps it is that lack of scandal (later it has been revealed that they both, secretly, favoured 'gay' relationships), no tragic ride into the sunset, which keeps them from being recognised today for what they were thenÃ¢â‚¬â€simply the leading romantic team of the 1920s.\n\n&quot;Like scenes out of Zola, the early sequences of Seventh Heaven manage to touch on drunkenness, prostitution, torture (by whipping and beating), starvation, suicide, and lying to the police, as well as the smug complacency of the better off.&quot;\n\n----------------------\n\n*ABOUT THIS SOUNDTRACK:\n\nA varied selection of music by great post-romantic classical composers has been chosen to enhance the flinty and powerful edge that makes this movie much more than a simple romantic melodrama, ruined by the over-sentimental soundtrack included in the released Fox DVD.\n\nread more details here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/jolonquessoundtracks/seventh-heaven-1927&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/jolonquessoundtracks/seventh-heaven-1927&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4d10318d2d718519253644ef69ec2ad8d3a739","amp;dn":"Seventh.Heaven.1927.silent.new.music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4d10318d2d718519253644ef69ec2ad8d3a739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,77,16,49,141,45,113,133,25,37,54,68,239,105,236,42,216,211,167,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
