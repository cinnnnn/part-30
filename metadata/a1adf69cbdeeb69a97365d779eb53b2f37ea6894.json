Woop, Matt Welch.\n\n2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nJohn F. Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nMY TAKE: I made my list of the best and worst possible presidents:\n\nRand Paul (R)\n\nGary Johnson (Libertarian)\n\nCarly Fiorina (R)\n\nJeb Bush (R)\n\nTed Cruz (R)\n\nScott Walker (R)\n\nRick Perry (R)\n\nMarco Rubio (R)\n\nJohn Kasich (R)\n\nBen Carson (R)\n\nBobby Jindal (R)\n\nJim Webb (D)\n\nGeorge Pataki (R)\n\nDonald Trump (R)\n\nLawrence Lessig (D)\n\nChris Christie (R)\n\nMartin O'Malley (D)\n\nLindsey Graham (R)\n\nLincoln Chafee (D)\n\nRick Santorum (R)\n\nJim Gilmore (R)\n\nBernie Sanders (Ind./D/Socialist)\n\nJoe Biden (D)\n\nHillary Clinton (D)\n\nMike Huckabee (R)\n\nJill Stein (Green)\n\nI acknowledge that my list is imperfect; it's based on how much a candidate seems to want to micromanage our lives and involve us in foreign wars\n\nPRESIDENTIAL TRACK RECORDS: Pundits bloviate non-stop about minute differences in the candidate's mannerisms; they follow the polls breathlessly. But on this show, we look at politicians' actual track records and their actual plans. Stossel gets help from a fair and balanced panel: libertarian Matt Welch of reason magazine, conservative Mary Katharine Ham of Hot Air, and liberal Ellis Hennican of Newsday.\n\nSPENDING: For me, spending is the biggest issue. All the candidates say: &quot;I'm going to be responsible.&quot;\n\nThe governors running actually have a track record we can compare. Jeb Bush did the best.\n\nIMMIGRATION: In his presidential announcement, Donald Trump attacked Mexican immigrants, and his popularity exploded. Is this how most Americans feel? Our panel analyzes.\n\nSEX, DRUGS, AND GUNS: How are the candidates on social issues? I say all drugs should be legal, but the Republican candidates are all against me on that.\n\nDEMOCRATIC RACE: The media claim the race for the Democratic presidential nomination is getting tighter, and Hillary is no longer a shoe in, but is that true? Our panel weighs in on which Democrat is best, and worst.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.08.28.Rate.the.Candidates.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 20s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 180 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 20s\nBit rate                                 : 1 041 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.158\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1041 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 20s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.8 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1adf69cbdeeb69a97365d779eb53b2f37ea6894","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.08.28.Rate.the.Candidates.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1adf69cbdeeb69a97365d779eb53b2f37ea6894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,173,246,156,189,238,182,154,151,54,93,119,158,181,59,47,55,234,104,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
