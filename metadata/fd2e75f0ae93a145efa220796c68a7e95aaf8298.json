As if that weren't enough, PITCHMAP provides functions to suppress individual sounds within a mix, and can apply advanced synthesizer-like sound transformations to your audio. In short, it is an inspiring musical instrument, a precision corrective tool and the only processor that literally lets you shape music with your hands.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/pitchmap&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zynaptiq.com/pitchmap&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhen so many groups bring you crap fakes non-working, X-FORCE always\ngets you the Best of the Best.
