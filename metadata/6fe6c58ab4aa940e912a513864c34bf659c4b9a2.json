But most who meet him don't know it, and don't live to talk about it: he's also an unseen, unstoppable contract killer, fulfilling hits from the safety of other people's bodies. How? His secret will rock civilization... and someone's after it. Betrayed by the last person he'd expect, how can Evan save the world when he can't even save himself? This series defies all categorization with more sudden plot twists than you can imagine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe6c58ab4aa940e912a513864c34bf659c4b9a2","amp;dn":"My+Flesh+Is+Cool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe6c58ab4aa940e912a513864c34bf659c4b9a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,230,197,138,180,170,148,14,145,42,81,56,100,195,75,246,89,196,185,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
