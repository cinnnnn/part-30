Later I digged in the web and realized that the french company Vogue, owned by Charles Delaunay and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on Kaba, produced this record for the first time in its subsidiary company Swing. By sheer chance, I was facing the first french - and world - edition of the famous concert... The original liner notes are signed by Delaunay: \\&quot;. . . The quartet\\'s music, marked with the seal of simplicity and good taste, surprises and pleases with its freshness and spontaneity, as with the efficacious swing of the rhythmic section. It is within this simplicity where one can find, doubtlessly, the secret of its success. Subtle, and full of details, the melodic lines designed by Gerry Mulligan and Bob Brookmeyer interweave, melt and contradict each other, but remain easy to follow. The audience ears, which often painfully decipher Modern Jazz arrangements, without effort appreciate the variations and the melodies embroidered by the soloists\\&quot;.\n\nPersonnel:\nGerry Mulligan, baritone sax\nBob Brookmeyer, valve trombone\nRed Mitchell, bass\nFrank Isola, drums\nOriginal photo by J.
