John Taylor...My card says I'm a detective, but what I really am is an expert on finding things. It's part of the Gift I was born with as a child of the Nightside - the hidden heart of London where it's always three a.m., where inhuman creatures and otherworldly gods walk side-by-side in the endless darkness of the soul.&quot;Assignment: Joanna Barrett hires me to track down her teenage daughter, who decided to forgo the circus and run away to the Nightside. The kid has no idea what she's getting herself into...You can find anything in the Nightside-if it doesn't find you first.&quot;John Taylor is not a private detective per se, but he has a knack for finding lost things. That's why he's been hired to descend into the Nightside, an otherworldly realm in the center of London where fantasy and reality share renting space and the sun never shines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13b25c5808b1a333ea12f206cd8acea66d8e1f4","amp;dn":"Something+from+the+Nightside+-+Simon+R.+Green+%28Unabridged+Book+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13b25c5808b1a333ea12f206cd8acea66d8e1f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,59,37,197,128,139,26,51,62,161,47,32,108,216,172,234,102,216,225,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
