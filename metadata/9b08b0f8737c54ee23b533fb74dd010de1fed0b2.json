Poh has mastered many exotic dishes and cooking styles, \n- but she's strangely intimidated when it comes to something as straightforward as meat and three veg. \n- She's determined to master the art of roasting, so this week her guest in the kitchen is the master of meat, \n- Neil Perry.Poh knows that only the best ingredients will satisfy Neil, so she jets off to Tasmania in search \n- of remarkable produce. Back in Poh's kitchen, Neil cooks an incredibly tender and moist slow-roasted rib of beef, \n- which he finishes with an amazing red wine reduction  or what Poh calls a pretty kick-ass gravy. Not to be outdone, \n- Poh shows Neil an old family favourite, pork belly with wood ear fungus and fermented bean curd\n- a slightly challenging name for a truly delicious dish.\n\nGroup News -\n\n- Looking for 100mbit+ Sites US EU ASiA\n- AU / NZ Cappers\n- Dumps for group usage\n\nContact - \n\n- autv hush.ai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b08b0f8737c54ee23b533fb74dd010de1fed0b2","amp;dn":"Pohs.Kitchen.S01E14.WS.PDTV.XviD-AUTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b08b0f8737c54ee23b533fb74dd010de1fed0b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,8,176,248,115,124,84,238,35,181,51,251,116,221,1,13,225,254,208,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
