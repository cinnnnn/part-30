Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, second only to Katharine Hepburn.\n\nI chose these films for this collection, because I feel that they best summarize Ingrid Bergman the actress. I do not think there are any current actress that have Ingrid Bergman's ability, to express emotion and thought with their face's and body language. She was truly  &quot;Sweden's illustrious gift to Hollywood.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b59d92fa3ab2de4b5f69a5f3816854348833ac8","amp;dn":"Ingrid+Bergman+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b59d92fa3ab2de4b5f69a5f3816854348833ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,89,217,47,163,171,45,228,181,246,154,95,56,22,133,67,72,131,58,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
