E.g.\n\n&quot;to make things even more enticing the songs are extremely well-crafted with driving grooves and awesome melodies that will stick to mind from the very beginning&quot; (Metalkaoz.com\n\nWhen this torrent is uploaded before the promotional work for &quot;Edge of the silverthorn&quot; have started. But a few music blogs have already noticed that the music have been available (we share everything on our own site as well) and then written some pretty nice judgement. \n\n&quot;Opener &quot;No Reason To Believe&quot; starts very atmospheric increasing the tempo into a melodic chorus with solid harmony vocals. A classic midtempo Melodic Hard rocker blending eighties Madison and the underrated Swedes Damned Nation's style. Killer track!&quot; (0DAYROCKZ)\n\n&quot;Lovely mix of 70s hard rock, NWOBHM and pomp&quot; (Roth'n'Roll)\n\n&quot;It's just like the weather in Ohio. Don't like it? Just wait a second and it will change! That's about how this 8 track albums rolls!&quot; (Heavy metal time machine)\n\n\nIt might be kind of kittle to compare yourself with other artists. But if we put it this way; Do you like any of the following bands? Rainbow, Savatage, Queensryche, Led Zeppelin, Styx, My Chemical Romance, Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf, Iron Maiden, Queen, Whitesnake, Kansas, Talisman, Journey, System of a down, White Lion, Edguy, Alice Cooper, Kamelot, Return, Muse, Thin Lizzy and so on?\n\nWe do, that's for sure! :)\n\nSo, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty big chance might enjoy at least some of the music here. Some influences are more obvious in some songs, so if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like one song, try another! So far, there are at lot of differences between them.\n\nAnd, this is a strictly official upload, it's completly legal to download it here. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also available on a couple of hundred of the most popular commcercial services, like iTunes, Spotify, Jamster, Wimp, Amazon and a lot of others. Choose the way to listen that you prefer the most :) \n\nwww.therockfordheroes.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b15eab675ad21c574422e19776cc7fb9be1a965","amp;dn":"The+Rockford+Heroes+-+Edge+of+the+silverthorn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b15eab675ad21c574422e19776cc7fb9be1a965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,21,234,182,117,173,33,197,116,66,46,25,119,108,199,251,155,225,169,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
