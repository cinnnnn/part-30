(See Guinness Book of World Records). Learn the muscles and their functions. Learn why the core of your body is probably the most important part of your body to keep strong.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the follow-up video to this one, Super ABS [Beginner] - DivX - DVDRip\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832463/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832463/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt will work you a lot harder than the beginners video so if you're still at beginners stage then this isn't for you yet. Have patience and build yourself up first and achieve reasonable fitness goals before advancing to this level or you could risk injury/burn-out which nobody wants to see happen. If, on the other hand, you found the beginners video a bit too &quot;lightweight&quot; for you then this should still tax you and give those abs the tough workout you're looking for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSuper Abs Advanced:\n\nIncludes advanced exercises using a variety of apparatus. Follow in a brief but killer abdominal routine that is certain to make your midsection stronger in the shortest amount of time. Approx. 45 min.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Super ABS [Advanced].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 440 MiB\nDuration                         : 46mn 21s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 326 Kbps\nWriting library                  : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 46mn 21s\nBit rate                         : 1 189 Kbps\nWidth                            : 512 pixels\nHeight                           : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.202\nStream size                      : 394 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.10.0\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 46mn 21s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 41.2 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.78 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 520 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 (beta)\n\n\n\nPlease help your fellow pirates by seeding after download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812689b220b1f56129d5c0f5f9886be3a6a37842","amp;dn":"Super+ABS+%5BAdvanced%5D+-+DivX+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812689b220b1f56129d5c0f5f9886be3a6a37842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,38,137,178,32,177,245,97,41,213,192,245,249,136,107,227,166,163,120,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
