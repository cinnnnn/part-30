Deeply embittered about the whole man's-inhumanity-to-man thing, she enacts a diabolical plot to unleash a swarm of mutant insects on the world that will destroy all living creatures except creepy crawlers.\n\nEnsnared in all this madness is a philandering island-hopping bug collector and his compliant and slightly pregnant wife, a humorless doctor from the mainland, and a United States airman named Charlie, whose way of starting a conversation is to hysterically scream &quot;Genocide!&quot; and then go off his rocker like the dedicated military professional he is.\n\nIf you want to watch a story where everybody gets their nuclear holocaust on in the grand tradition of radioactive Japanese monster movies, this is the film for you!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCinematic Titanic is a project by Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) creator and original host, Joel Hodgson.[1] The project involves &quot;riffing&quot; B-movies, in a manner similar to that of MST3K.[2] Joining Hodgson are many of the original MST3K cast, as well as some cast members who joined later in the show's run.[3] These include Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.[4] It was first performed live on December 7, 2007 and first aired on December 22, 2007.\n\nOn February 16, 2013, it was announced that the touring portion of Cinematic Titanic was going on an indefinite hiatus. According to an email sent out to members of the site, due to &quot;5 people living in 5 different cities with different lives and projects, it has become increasingly difficult to coordinate our schedules and give Cinematic Titanic the attention it requires to keep growing as a creative enterprise and a business.&quot;[5] The final tour began on September 23, 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcadd88f5e739d824fc685028e0ad3a668659aa","amp;dn":"Cinematic+Titanic+-+11+-+War+Of+The+Insects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcadd88f5e739d824fc685028e0ad3a668659aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,202,221,136,245,231,57,216,36,252,104,80,40,224,173,58,102,134,89,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
