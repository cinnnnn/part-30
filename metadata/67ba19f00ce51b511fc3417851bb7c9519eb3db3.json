The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nToday on this Sunday, May 13, 2012 edition, Alex breaks down the ongoing hoax that is the War on Terror, with focus on the the CIA catching the CIA in the latest &quot;al Qaeda plot&quot;-- admittedly led by a CIA informant. Clearly, the globalists will tell any lie to keep the population in fear and complicit in the violation of their rights. Later, Alex plays a key speech from presidential candidate Ron Paul while campaigning in Austin, Texas, as well as a speech from his son, Senator Rand Paul, as the flame of liberty becomes a family affair. Doug Hagmann discusses with Alex the impending potential for a massive civil war, created through government-sponsored crisis, and what people can do to prepare for it and how to avoid and limit exposure to its devastating consequences.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
