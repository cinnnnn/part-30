Thicker Than Water was a little project drawn up by Johnson and his fellow surf mates, Chris and Dan Malloy, and the documentary went on to win the Video of the Year award in Surfer magazine in 2000. Johnson's laid-back summer jams accompanied the film, but it took until he became a touring sensation for these songs to be released to the masses. Thicker Than Water, which is scored by Johnson, collects 14 previously unavailable tracks by the likes of G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, the Meters, Finley Quaye, and Johnson himself. Breezy acoustic guitars and sun-soaked harmonies are perfectly in place throughout Johnson's newer songs (&quot;Moonshine,&quot; &quot;The Cove,&quot; &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot;), highlighting what was soon to come to him as a solo artist. Other standout tracks from Natural Calamity, surfer/producer Todd Hannigan, and Smoke City round out the relaxing atmosphere of Thicker Than Water. It's a definite collection addition for any Jack Johnson fan and an enjoyable listen for those interested in his life as a pro surfer.
