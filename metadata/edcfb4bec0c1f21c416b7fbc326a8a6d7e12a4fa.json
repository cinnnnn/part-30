But life ought not be wasted. You don't need to know a lot of things to make a lasting difference in the world, but you do have to know the few, great, unchanging, and glorious things that matter and be willing to live and to die for them.\n\nJohn Piper's plea to a generation is, &quot;Don't waste your life!&quot; This book is a passionate call to make your life count for eternity. He acknowledges that there are risks for those who seek to make a lasting difference by faith, yet he believes that they are risks worth taking for the cause of the Gospel.\n\nIf you believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain, read this book, learn to live for Christ, and grab the opportunity to make your life matter!\n\nPlease seed. Sharing is caring! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edcfb4bec0c1f21c416b7fbc326a8a6d7e12a4fa","amp;dn":"Don%27t+waste+your+life+-+John+Piper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edcfb4bec0c1f21c416b7fbc326a8a6d7e12a4fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,207,180,190,192,193,242,28,65,107,127,188,50,106,138,109,126,18,164,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
