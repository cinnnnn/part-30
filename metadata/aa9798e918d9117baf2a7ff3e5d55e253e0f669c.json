After relocating to Tulsa, OK from\n   Ft. Collins, CO, he established Armstrong Recording studio to not only record\n   bands from all genres, but also to work on his own music. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been writing\n   tons of music, but haven't had a regular outlet for all the songs I've come\n   up with,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Egerton. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFinally, my wife suggested that I ask some of my\n   friends to do the singing, since it's definitely my weak suit.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ With that\n   suggestion came the early stages of The Seven Degrees of Stephen Egerton.\n\n   After writing all the music, playing all the instruments, and even recording\n   all the songs himself, Stephen sent the demos to friends from his over two\n   decade-plus long career in music. Egerton contacted a number of musicians to\n   collaborate with, and soon Stephen had vocal contributions from Dan Andriano\n   (Alkaline Trio), Joey Cape (Lagwagon/Me First And The Gimme Gimmes), Mike\n   Herrera (MXPX), Chris Demakes (Less Than Jake), Chad Price (All/Drag The\n   River), Scott Reynolds (All/Steaming Beast) and more.\n\n   Egerton left most of the lyrical duties to the talented punk vocalists, and\n   only co-wrote a handful of the sixteen tracks. Egerton mixed and mastered the\n   album on his own, which allowed for the consistent sound despite being\n   recorded in over a dozen studios by different technicians across the country.\n   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have some seriously talented friends. I'm so proud of this record, and I\n   can't wait for people to hear it!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he exclaims with a sigh of relief.\n\n\n   1  \t Flip (Feat. John Speck Of The Fags)\n   2 \tFire's On (Feat.
