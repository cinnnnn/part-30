Before disappearing two months earlier, Motorcycle Boy outlawed gang wars, or &quot;rumbles,&quot; by a treaty. When Rusty James breaks the treaty in a fight with Biff Wilcox, and gets seriously hurt, his brother suddenly appears. Distracted, delusional and enigmatic, his brother seems haunted and disinterested in his past as a &quot;neighborhood novelty.&quot; Over the next few days, James' dead end life of posturing seems to fall apart; he loses his girlfriend, his friends, his own sense of confidence. The future looms like a dark, unknown wall locking James in. Through Motorcycle Boy's example, he finally learns to break free from others' expectations, and his own inner demons.\n\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\nWriters: S.E. Hinton (novel) S.E.
