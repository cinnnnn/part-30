The recordings focus on Tchaikovsky's original, uncut scores in virtuoso performances by Lowenthal, accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra, directed by the late Sergiu Comissiona. The recordings, made in the late 1980s, were originally released on Arabesque. Both discs have been re-mastered for this release by Grammy-winning engineer, Adam Abeshouse. This set includes Pianos Concertos 1, 2 &amp; 3 (original versions) and Concert fantasy.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368b97d8ee2db2d7167ea99408da38731a1ee6e2","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky+-+The+Music+for+Piano+%26+Orchestra+-+Jerome+Lowenthal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368b97d8ee2db2d7167ea99408da38731a1ee6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,139,151,216,238,45,178,215,22,126,169,148,8,218,56,115,26,30,230,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
