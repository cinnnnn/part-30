With the tracks at hand, he revealed himself as a fine all-round musician, band leader and brilliant soloist, both in trumpet and valve trombone. Bill HomanÃ¢â‚¬â€œwhose works can be considered as some of the most representative of the West Coast school of jazzÃ¢â‚¬â€œonce said, &quot;I've always tried to write things that sound like jazz, not like Bach revisited.&quot; Thanks to his arrangements and to the exceptional musicians who perform them, Ferguson expresses himself in a way he had never previously found possible.\n\nTrack list:\nCD 1 - Maynard Ferguson and His Octet\n1.
