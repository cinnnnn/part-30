I was surprised at how good this sounds from the vinyl as 24-96 files - very clear and immediate, with only occasional guitar parts betraying that distant &quot;audience recording&quot; sound. It's a big improvement on the BMG CD version, with less surface noise/hum/static, and with a softer, richer sound than that slightly harsh CD quality audio. And being a higher resolution, lower generation recording, why wouldn't it be? Unedited, this runs 11 seconds slower than the RMG CD version, which, from a cursory listen, is clearly straight off the LP and unedited. The show is very well received by the audience, and George isn't hoarse...\n\nShow identifiers (Track 1):\n 0:13 &quot;Hello Long Beach!&quot;\n 4:12 &quot;It's very nice to be here, I tell you!&quot;\n\nEdits made:\n 1. Sue me sue you Blues - a couple of seconds patched in from elsewhere in the song where the tape became briefly muted/muffled, around 0:53-0:56. Unnoticeable.\n\n2. For you Blue - gap on LP closed and start of song faded in/segued (the song is missing its start on the LP). End faded to merge seamlessly with next track (Side 2 of LP).\n\n3. Nothing from nothing - gap on LP closed and start of song faded in/segued (the song is missing its start on the LP). End faded to merge seamlessly with My Sweet Lord (whose very start is missing).\n\nEquipment &amp; Lineage:\n Mint TMOQ LP\n Technics 1200 Turntable, KAB record clamp\n Ortofon Black 2M cartridge\n Yamaha DSP-A3090 amplifier\n E-MU 404\n Cool edit Pro (general editing)\n Adobe soundbooth (declicking @ 25%)\n Recorded at 32 bit, 192 kHz &gt; 32/96 during declicking &gt; 24/96 at end of editing.\n\nArtwork included: the original LP artwork is cheap and cheesy, to say the least! A one-sided photocopy on plain green paper to sit in the plastic LP holder, while the LP sleeve itself is just plain white on both sides. It's been tidied up a bit for a CD case, with corrections to the spelling of &quot;Budda&quot; and the name of the first track (&quot;Opening Jam&quot;), and a realignment of the title at the top has (from the left of the page into the centre), but still maintaining its original home-made look.\n\nConvert to mp3 for personal use only, if you must... But please don't post mp3s of this on other sites like guitars101...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc77ccc7cfa96234cdbe317b0a709506e3c0a0b2","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+George+Harrison+-+Long+Beach+Arena%2C+10.11.74%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc77ccc7cfa96234cdbe317b0a709506e3c0a0b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,119,204,199,207,169,98,52,205,190,49,123,10,112,149,6,227,192,160,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
