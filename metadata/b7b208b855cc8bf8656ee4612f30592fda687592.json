She meets Willow, Xander and Giles and they apologize to each other. They also realize that the monsters were not captured by the Initiative, but actually they are the Trojan Horse of Adam to fight against the commando from inside. Once Buffy alone is not able to defeat Adam, the Scooby gang decides to transfer the best of each one of them, i.e., the witch power of Willow, the strength of Xander and the expertise of Giles, to Buffy through witchcraft to make her powerful and capable of fighting against Adam. Meanwhile, Riley finds that he has a chip over his heart and connected to his central nervous system to modify his behavior and obey Adam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b208b855cc8bf8656ee4612f30592fda687592","amp;dn":"Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+S04E21+-+Primeval.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b208b855cc8bf8656ee4612f30592fda687592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,178,8,184,85,204,139,248,101,110,228,97,47,48,89,47,218,104,117,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
