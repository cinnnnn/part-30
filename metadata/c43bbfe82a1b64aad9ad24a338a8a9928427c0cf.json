Andrew Wyke (Michael Cain), an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle (Jude Law),an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again). When Wyke invite Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However, Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife&amp;#039;s new lover, and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43bbfe82a1b64aad9ad24a338a8a9928427c0cf","amp;dn":"Sleuth%5B2007%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-FXG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43bbfe82a1b64aad9ad24a338a8a9928427c0cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,59,191,232,42,27,100,170,217,173,36,163,56,168,169,146,132,39,192,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
