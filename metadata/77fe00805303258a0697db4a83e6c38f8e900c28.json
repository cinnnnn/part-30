The papers we were\r\nprivileged to examine showed that the purpose of those at\r\nWellington House was to effect a change in the opinion of\r\nthe British people who were adamantly opposed to war with\r\nGermany, a formidable task that was accomplished by\r\n&quot;opinion making&quot; through polling. The staff consisted of\r\nArnold Toynbee, a future director of studies at the Royal\r\nInstitute of International Affairs (RIIA), Lords Norhcliffe,\r\nand the Americans, Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays.\r\n\r\nBernays was born in Vienna on November 22, 1891. As the\r\nnephew of Sigmund Freud the father of psychoanalysis,\r\nregarded by many as &quot;the father of public relations&quot; although\r\nthe title properly belongs to Willy Munzenberg. Bernays\r\npioneered the use of psychology and other social sciences to\r\nshape and form public opinion so that the public thought such\r\nmanufactured opinions were their own.\r\n\r\n&quot;If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group\r\nmind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses\r\naccording to our will without them knowing it.&quot; Bernays\r\npostulated. He called this technique &quot;Engineering Consent.\r\nOne of his best-known techniques of achieving this goal was\r\nthe indirect use of what he called third party authorities to\r\nshape the desired opinions: &quot;If you can influence the leaders,\r\neither with or without their conscious cooperation, you\r\nautomatically influence the group which they sway. This\r\ntechnique he called &quot;opinion making.&quot;\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can now begin to understand how it was that\r\nWilson, Roosevelt, Clinton, Bush the elder and the younger\r\ncould so easily lead American into disastrous wars in which\r\nits people should never have become involved.\r\nThe joint British and American participants concentrated\r\ntheir efforts on techniques as yet not tried out, to mobilize\r\nsupport for the war looming on the horizon.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the British people did not want war, and\r\nsaid so, but Toynbee, Lippmann and Bernays expected to\r\nchange that by applying techniques designed to manipulate\r\npublic opinion through the use of polling. Herein we provide\r\na review of the methods that were devised and executed to\r\nbring Great Britain and the United States into the First World\r\nWar, plus the techniques that were put into practice between\r\nthe two World Wars and beyond. As will be seen propaganda\r\nwas to play a major role.\r\n\r\nOne of the main objectives at Tavistock was to achieve the\r\ndegradation of women. Tavistock recognized that Jesus\r\nChrist has brought a new place of respect in the order of\r\ncivilization to womanhood, which prior to his coming had\r\nnot been present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
