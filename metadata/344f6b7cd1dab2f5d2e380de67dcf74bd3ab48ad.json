Julia awoke in the hospital with a broken leg, a new talent for drawing and false memories of the accident, in which she dies and Monica lives. The doctors attribute this to her head injury, but no one can explain how a bracelet engraved with her name ended up at the scene of the accident. A bracelet no one has ever seen before.\n\nClassmate Evan Whittaker paid Julia no attention before the accident, let alone after. Now suddenly he's volunteering to tutor her and offering to drive her home. She can't ignore that his new obsession started after his two-day disappearance last week and that he wears a pendant she's been drawing for months. When the police show up one night looking for Evan, he begs Julia to run with him, convincing her that Monica is still alive. Julia agrees to go, never guessing where he's really from.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:344f6b7cd1dab2f5d2e380de67dcf74bd3ab48ad","amp;dn":"Here+-+Denise+Grover+Swank.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"344f6b7cd1dab2f5d2e380de67dcf74bd3ab48ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,79,107,124,209,218,178,245,210,227,128,222,103,220,247,75,211,171,72,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
