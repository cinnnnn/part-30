Shields evokes his deeply divided personality (his &quot;ridiculous&quot; ambivalence), his character flaws, his woes, his serious despairs. Books are his life, but when they come to feel unlifelike and archaic, he revels in a new kind of art that is based heavily on quotation and consciousness and self-consciousness--perfect, since so much of what ails him is acute self-consciousness. And he shares with us a final irony: he wants &quot;literature to assuage human loneliness, but nothing can assuage human loneliness. Literature doesn't lie about this--which is what makes it essential.&quot;\n\nA captivating, thought-provoking, utterly original way of thinking about the essential acts of reading and writing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faacefa0e1028b554da3cf2a3e6a404805f775fd","amp;dn":"How+Literature+Saved+My+Life+-+David+Shields++%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faacefa0e1028b554da3cf2a3e6a404805f775fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,172,239,160,225,2,139,85,77,163,207,42,62,106,64,72,5,247,117,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
