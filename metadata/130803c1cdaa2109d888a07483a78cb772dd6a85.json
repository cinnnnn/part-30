Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\n\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130803c1cdaa2109d888a07483a78cb772dd6a85","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+061-070","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130803c1cdaa2109d888a07483a78cb772dd6a85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,8,3,193,205,170,33,9,216,136,160,116,131,167,140,183,114,221,106,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
