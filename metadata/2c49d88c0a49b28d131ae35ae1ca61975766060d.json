COMPLETE CONCENTRIC RECORDINGS\n\nLabel: \tFRESH SOUND\nNumber: \t448\nItem Code: \t60997\nFormat: \tCD\nGenre: \t\nDates: \t(1965)\n\t\nDescription:\nLate in the summer of 1965, the excellent performances of Tete Montoliu's trio at the club Jamboree in Barcelona had surpassed even the wildest expectations. The pianist, Eric Peter and Billy Brooks were at their creative best, so much so that, by fall, they recorded for the newly formed label Concentric. The immediate results were an album that went by the name &quot;A tot jazz,&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€the first 12 inch LP to be produced in its entirety by a Spanish labelÃ¢â‚¬â€and an EP single. A year later, ConcÃƒÂ¨ntric released the second volume of &quot;A tot Jazz&quot; using the remaining material from that recording session. You will find here, for the first time on a single CD, these two essential albums in the pianist's extensive discography. Let's enjoy, once again, the fantastic performances of this legendary trio led by Tete Montoliu.\n\nSongs: \t\n Stella By Starlight\n I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\n Scandia Sky\n Fly Me To The Moon\n Lament\n Au Privave\n Chim Chim Cheree\n Polka Dots And Moonbeams\n Secret Love\n Salt Peanuts\n Israel\n Sometime Ago\n Come Rain Or Come Shine\n Have You Met Miss Jones?\n\nPersonnel: Eric Peter, Billy Brooks \t\n\nSource: http://www.worldsrecords.com/pages/artists/m/montoliu_tete/tete_montoliu_60997.html\n------\n\n\nTete Montoliu\n\nTete Montoliu was born and reared in Spain, oceans away from popular American jazz. Born blind, Montoliu learned how to read music using braille. When listening to Montoliu's work, his playing is almost messianic in substance. His technique on the piano is bright, and his personality is even brighter.\n\nTete had an exceptional ability of expressing his musical ideas, quite clearly. His aggressive style of playing is mirrored in many contemporary jazz artists of today. Montuliu was pioneering his freshly creative style in the late 1950s, and yet his work is so contemporary it's prophetic.\n\nMontoliu worked his way up through the chain of New York musicians, playing with most of the greats, and quickly earning the respect of the city's in-crowd. Not an easy task for a young blind Spaniard in the early 1950s. Montoliu also later played extensively in Europe, being among the first to bring the music to an overseas audience. A Tot Jazz (1965) is perhaps one of his greatest known works. The playing is pointed and sharp, and the mood is classic jazz at its best. Moving forward, to the past few decades, albums like Tete! (1995) portray a matured Tete dancing with unmatched control. Tete's playing carries unbelievable nuance, and is very round in comparison to the music of many of his peers.\n\nFrom: Roland Hanna, Tete Montoliu, and Andre Previn, By SEAN DIETRICH\nPublished: June 6, 2010, at all about jazz\nSource: http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36610\n------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c49d88c0a49b28d131ae35ae1ca61975766060d","amp;dn":"Tete+Montoliu+-+A+Tot+Jazz%21+Complete+Concentric+Recordings+%281965","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c49d88c0a49b28d131ae35ae1ca61975766060d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,73,216,140,10,73,178,141,19,26,227,90,225,202,97,151,87,102,6,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
