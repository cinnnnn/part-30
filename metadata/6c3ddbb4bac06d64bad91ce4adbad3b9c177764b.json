I have 3 different Copys of this Video and I took the best version and Converted it to a DVD from VHS and used ULEAD software. If my computer was a little more up to date, I could have made this better! Everytime I tried to make this video better, my computer would get bogged down very bad but I still give this DVD a B plus.\n\nThis is the last known Video of Roy Buchanan and Roy is on fire showing off his (Roy) new guitar known as the Blues Master by The Fritz Brothers. This is the Very Raw and uncut Version of Custom Made. I have that version also. This is a must for Roy Buchanan Lovers are Guitarist such as myself. I do not have any art work for this but I did make some chapters. This Video was made about 5 months before Roys Death. Roy shaved his Head about 2 weeks after this Video was made for what that is worth.\n\nRoy Buchanan was the King of the String Benders!! Please share. thanks, RICK1957 from Roys DC HUB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3ddbb4bac06d64bad91ce4adbad3b9c177764b","amp;dn":"Roy+Buchanan-The+Last+Session+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3ddbb4bac06d64bad91ce4adbad3b9c177764b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,61,219,180,186,192,109,100,186,217,28,228,173,186,211,185,193,119,118,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
