It is a story of a war without end and of those who resist.\nThe product of over two years of filming on the inside of movements on five continents, &quot;The Fourth World War&quot; is a film that would have been unimaginable at any other moment in history. Directed by the makers of &quot;This Is What Democracy Looks Like&quot; and &quot;Zapatista&quot;, produced through a global network of independent media and activist groups, it is a truly global film from our global movement. \n\n\nSUBS: ENG - SPA - GER - FRA - SLO - PT/BR\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bignoisefilms.com/4ww/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bignoisefilms.com/4ww/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439574/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439574/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwww.makingoff.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf264c2dd5f4878e4b52089707009eb15acb4b62","amp;dn":"The+Fourth+World+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf264c2dd5f4878e4b52089707009eb15acb4b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,38,76,45,213,244,135,142,75,82,8,151,7,0,158,177,90,203,75,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
