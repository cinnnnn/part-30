The resultant fifty minutes plays out as a wonderfully varied sequence that focusses on melodically resonant electronic music. You'll hear some of the compositional techniques Kenniff has become known for at work, cutting a tuneful, glitched-up swathe through opener 'Convivium', while the crunchily filtered, slow-core beats of 'Friedel' and 'Distance' channel a hazy, opiated quality. Taking this a little further, the creaking deep bass and beautiful electronic post-rock of 'Cross The Ocean' is touched by the influence of Boards Of Canada, something that could also be said of the downtempo, beat-heavy ambience of 'Bounce Dive', though there's a more playful and openly tuneful quality to Kenniff's music compared to that of the Brothers Eoin, something highlighted by the airier, brighter productions of the Portlander's music. There's also a pronounced cinematic quality to all this, and you can well imagine Kenniff being recruited to score a film at some point down the line, especially given beautifully crafted, acoustic guitar-driven pieces like 'South Tree' or the upbeat, piano-heavy 'The Morning Room', both of which showcase this side of his output very strongly.\n\nTracklist:\n01 Convivium.mp3\t9.80 MB\n02 Cross the Ocean.mp3\t12.28 MB\n03 The Evening Walk.mp3\t8.95 MB\n04 Bounce Dive.mp3\t13.21 MB\n05 Every Hair on Your Head.mp3\t9.13 MB\n06 South Tree.mp3\t9.32 MB\n07 Friedel.mp3\t13.26 MB\n08 Distance.mp3\t10.29 MB\n09 Carry with Us.mp3\t9.31 MB\n10 The Jaguar Sun.mp3\t10.28 MB\n11 The Morning Room.mp3\t11.07 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0d75f8ef06a8d1c7db05871fd67743e282bcef","amp;dn":"Helios+-+Unleft+%5B2010%5D+%5BAnthology%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+HoTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0d75f8ef06a8d1c7db05871fd67743e282bcef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,13,117,248,239,6,168,209,199,219,5,135,31,214,119,67,226,130,188,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
