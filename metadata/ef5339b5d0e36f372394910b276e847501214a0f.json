The film is based on the real-life travails of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty, who after suffering under Nazi persecution was imprisoned by the new Communist regime for remaining loyal to his religious convictions. Alec Guinness, his head shaved, plays an unnamed Cardinal in an unspecified Eastern European country who is clapped into jail. Here he is ordered by the politicos to issue a phony statement to his flock, one that will effectively end Catholicism in his country. Jack Hawkins plays the diabolically clever &quot;Interrogator&quot;, who is almost successful in convincing Guinness  that his false statement will have a beneficial effect. The Prisoner fared better in its American release than it did in Europe, where it was branded both &quot;pro-Communist&quot; and &quot;anti-Communist&quot; by various single-issue pressure groups. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The prisoner.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.13 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1 527 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.870\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.252\n      Stream size : 1.00 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 129 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048512/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048512/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPeter Glenville - The prisoner [1955]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5339b5d0e36f372394910b276e847501214a0f","amp;dn":"Peter+Glenville+-+The+prisoner+%5B1955%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5339b5d0e36f372394910b276e847501214a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,83,57,181,208,227,111,55,35,148,145,11,39,110,132,117,1,33,74,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
