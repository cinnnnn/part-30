It is an edited book and is not comprehensive as well in the mentioned field. Few synthetic strategies along with bioactivity are presented, and some limitations were raised in order to arouse curiosity of the reader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5b0f37f457b6583f67584ffec6ea1c38c5d9c2","amp;dn":"Scope+of+Selective+Heterocycles+from+Organic+and+Pharmaceutical+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5b0f37f457b6583f67584ffec6ea1c38c5d9c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,91,15,55,244,87,182,88,63,103,88,79,254,198,234,28,56,197,217,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
