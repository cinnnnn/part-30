I had to build a platform around my HP flatbed scanner so I would be able to scan sections. It required 12 scans to capture the whole map.\nI then had to use paint software to try to remove the very visible cardboard fold damage. After that, stitching software was required to join the sections. It took 6 stitches, which had to be attempted multiple times to get a decent outcome, since more than 1 edge was involved.\nYes it was a big job, which was why I did not do the Journey's map as had been my intention.\n\nThe results are not perfect but this is still the best digital version of this map presently available. \n\n I am reissuing this torrent  slightly renamed with this .nfo file because it has been copied to torrent sites using exactly the same name as my original, thereby preventing me from uploading it to some sites","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55df6345d2f66deda0f3a3f5d451aec4166e5fb8","amp;dn":"The+Known+World+of+Ice+and+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55df6345d2f66deda0f3a3f5d451aec4166e5fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,223,99,69,210,246,109,237,160,243,163,245,212,81,174,196,22,110,95,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
