After 2 months and hundreds of hours of wiretapping, the FBI and RCMP staged a late-night raid to apprehend the most wanted man in cyberspaceÃ¢â‚¬â€a 15-year-old kid, Mafiaboy. 8 years later, Mafiaboy, a.k.a.Michael Calce, has ignored requests from every major media outlet in North America and has not told a word of his storyÃ¢â‚¬â€until now. Using his experience as a cautionary tale, Calce takes the reader through the history of hacking and how it has helped make the internet the new frontier for crime in the 21st century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66ed404b9d0c07ce606e1804725d42a9eda120f5","amp;dn":"Mafiaboy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66ed404b9d0c07ce606e1804725d42a9eda120f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,237,64,75,157,12,7,206,96,110,24,4,114,93,66,169,237,161,32,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
