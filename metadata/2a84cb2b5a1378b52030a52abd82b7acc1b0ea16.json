It's a crazy mix of genres, like this DVD. Basically, if you don't LOVE music, you probably won't love this mix. \n\nThere's a throwback in there: &quot;Lights&quot; by Ellie Goulding. I don't think I gave that song a fair listen the first time around. Then one day recently it was in my head and I was thinking, who the hell is that? Well I found out and while I still not feeling any of her other popular songs, I concede that &quot;Lights&quot; is a brilliant song and performance. Miley Cyrus still sucks ass.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a84cb2b5a1378b52030a52abd82b7acc1b0ea16","amp;dn":"Blazin%27+Hot+Groove+%28EDM%2C+RnB%2C+Soul%2C+Alt%29+Music+Videos+August+201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a84cb2b5a1378b52030a52abd82b7acc1b0ea16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,132,203,43,90,19,120,181,32,48,165,42,189,130,183,172,193,176,234,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
