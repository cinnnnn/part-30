Now Larry Tye, the prize-winning journalist and New York Times bestselling author of Satchel, has written the first full-fledged history not just of the Man of Steel but of the creators, designers, owners, and performers who made him the icon he is today.\n  \nLegions of fans from Boston to Buenos Aires can recite the story of the child born Kal-El, scion of the doomed planet Krypton, who was rocketed to Earth as an infant, raised by humble Kansas farmers, and rechristened Clark Kent. Known to law-abiders and evildoers alike as Superman, he was destined to become the invincible champion of all that is good and justÃ¢â‚¬â€and a star in every medium from comic books and comic strips to radio, TV, and film.\n  \nBut behind the high-flying legend lies a true-to-life saga every bit as compelling, one that begins not in the far reaches of outer space but in the middle of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartland. During the depths of the Great Depression, Jerry Siegel was a shy, awkward teenager in Cleveland. Raised on adventure tales and robbed of his father at a young age, Jerry dreamed of a hero for a boy and a world that desperately needed one. Together with neighborhood chum and kindred spirit Joe Shuster, young Siegel conjured a human-sized god who was everything his creators yearned to be: handsome, stalwart, and brave, able to protect the innocent, punish the wicked, save the day, and win the girl. It was on SupermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s muscle-bound back that the comic book and the very idea of the superhero took flight.\n  \n\nTye chronicles the adventures of the men and women who kept Siegel and ShusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Man of TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aloft and vitally alive through seven decades and counting. Here are the savvy publishers and visionary writers and artists of comicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Golden Age who ushered the red-and-blue-clad titan through changing eras and evolving incarnations; and the actorsÃ¢â‚¬â€including George Reeves and Christopher ReeveÃ¢â‚¬â€who brought the Man of Steel to life on screen, only to succumb themselves to all-too-human tragedy in the mortal world. Here too is the poignant and compelling history of Siegel and ShusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong struggle for the recognition and rewards rightly due to the architects of a genuine cultural phenomenon.\n \n  \nFrom two-fisted crimebuster to ÃƒÂ¼ber-patriot, social crusader to spiritual savior, SupermanÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps like no other mythical character before or sinceÃ¢â‚¬â€has evolved in a way that offers a Rorschach test of his times and our aspirations. In this deftly realized appreciation, Larry Tye reveals a portrait of America over seventy years through the lens of that otherworldly hero who continues to embody our best selves.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5a7b81a089e9a871c940f5ab46a46fa6a905fe","amp;dn":"Superman+-+The+High+Flying+History+of+America%27s+Most+Enduring+He","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5a7b81a089e9a871c940f5ab46a46fa6a905fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,90,123,129,160,137,233,168,113,201,64,245,171,70,164,111,166,169,5,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
