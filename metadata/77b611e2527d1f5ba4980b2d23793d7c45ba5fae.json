It is influenced by Ukrainian, Greek, Romanian, Gypsy, Sephardic Jewish and Ottoman Turkish music, which merged in the cross-cultural melting pot of Balkan towns. Whatever its exact definition, it is a music which, after a few notes, makes your heart feel too big for your chest.\n\n\n\nThere are numerous instrumental pieces and songs performed by professional and folk musicians revealing the importance of this music to post war (1992-1995) Bosnian identity. This is a view into a world of great beauty and harrowing darkness, ultimately addressing questions of cultural identity standing against barbarism.\n\n \n\nLEARN MORE:\n\nVisit the filmmaker, Robert Golden Pictures\n\nPurchase the 77-minute version of the film on DVD\n\n \n\n\n \n\nAbout DOC-DEBUT\n\nThis film is airing as part of DOC-DEBUT, a series on Link TV highlighting unique and groundbreaking international documentary films.
