When shown in countries that have already seen the UK version, the US series is retitled It's a Man's World. The theme song &quot;Bad Boy&quot; written by Larry Williams is performed by Marshall Crenshaw.\n\nKevin and Jamie are two roommates. Kevin is irresponsible and sloppy, but compared to super-slob and slacker Jamie, Kevin looks almost anal-retentive. While both are content to wallow in their immaturity, Kevin must contend with his girlfriend Sarah's attempt to improve him. Jamie is always ready to provide immoral support.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bacfa31c93204d2c5b8a732d4ca7190a2f2fe382","amp;dn":"Men+Behaving+Badly+US+Season+1+and+2+COMPLETE+-+MovieGuru","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bacfa31c93204d2c5b8a732d4ca7190a2f2fe382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,207,163,28,147,32,77,44,91,138,115,45,76,167,25,10,47,47,227,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
