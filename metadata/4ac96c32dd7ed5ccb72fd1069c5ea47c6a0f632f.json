For some bizarre reason Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band re-recorded the \nsong in 1995 and released that re-recording on 'Greatest Hits' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but it pales in comparison to this original.\n06 Different mix than on the one released on 'Tracks'.\n07 Bruce borrowed the first two lines from Chuck BerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBye Bye JohnnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (as well as the play on the title), \nwhich is why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s registered as a Springsteen-Berry composition.\n08 Originally recorded for &quot;Darkness&quot;, and recorded again here, this was considered for the 'Greatest Hits' collection but was finally dropped.\n09 Full, unedited version that includes lyric changes and the complete raucous ending. This track runs nearly a full 1:30 longer than the released version.\n10 Slighly different version / mix.\n11 A bit longer version.\n12 Beautiful keyboards by Danny and Roy augment some fine acoustic guitar playing by Bruce.\n13 Presented in best-ever quality, this unreleased gem far eclipses any current circulated versions.\n14 Unreleased studio outtake.\n15 Wonderful tune with a killer chorus - note the bass line similar to the Human Touch B-side '30 Days Out'\n16 Short but energetic rocker.\n\n* 'Thrill Hill West' is SpringsteenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home studio in Los Angeles (aka 'Hollywood Hills Garage Studio').\n* Most band tracks are E Street Band backing versions from so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œelectric Nebraska sessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--\n\nDisc Two (2) details:\n\nRecording details:\n- Track 1 recorded at The Hit Factory, from the April-June 1983 sessions.\n- Track 3 PROBABLY recorded at The Hit Factory during Jan or early Feb 1982. May be from later.\n- Track 2 recorded at The Power Station, April or May 1982.\n- Track 4 recorded at The Hit Factory, June 16, 1983\n- Track 5 recorded at The Hit Factory, May 5, 1982.\n- Track 6 recorded at The Hit Factory, April 20, 1983.\n- Track 7 recorded at The Power Station during April or May 1982. \n- Track 8 recorded at The Hit Factory, Feb 1982.\n- Track 9 recorded at The Hit Factory, June 13, 1983.\n- Track 10 recorded at The Hit Factory, April or May 1983.\n- Tracks 11,13 recorded at Thrill Hill West, August 1982 through April 1983.\n- Tracks 12,14,16 recorded at Thrill Hill West, January through May 1983.\n- Track 15 recorded at Thrill Hill West, January 4, 1983.\n\nSource details:\n- Tracks 1,2,3,4,5,6 from 'Murder Incorporated', FR03\n- Track 7 from 'This Hard Land', BS2002\n- Tracks 9,10 from 'Lost Masters XIX', LOVE 019\n- Tracks 14,16, from 'Lost Masters XVII', LOVE 017\n- Track 12 from 'Lost Masters XVIII', LOVE 018\n- Tracks 15,11,13 from 'Lost Masters XVI', LOVE 016\n- Track 8 from 'Lost Masters IV', LOVE 004\n\nTrack descriptions:\n01 The original mix without the new (90's) vocal track or the overdubbed second guitar on 'The Essential BS'. One of my favourite tracks, too bad the sound quality is what it is.\n02 Different mix permutation of the same core recording as #1.\n03 Completely different recording than the released 'Cover Me' done in a dramatically different arrangement. \nThis may actually date from a later period in the sessions than the original 'Cover Me'.\n04 Same core recording as on 'Tracks', but has a much longer fade out (very nice) and features Steve Van Zandt on background vocals and guitar.\n05 Different mix permutation of the same core recording as #1.\n06 Different mix than on the one released on 'Tracks'.\n07 Includes slightly different lyrics and an alternate beginning and ending.\n08 This song was given to Donna Summer, who was recording an album at the time at the same studio. \nSummerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cover version (with Springsteen on guitar) was recorded in March 1982 (released Aug 82). \nBruce and Donna also recorded a duet vocal version at her sessions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it remains uncirculating.\n09 Original mix with the saxophone track (deleted on 'Tracks').\n10 Features Ruth Jackson on background vocals. Possibly recorded at the same session as 'My Hometown' (which also features Jackson).\n11 By far the definitive version of this song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ contains an additional, important lyric verse that has been cut from all the other versions.\n12 Brilliant song that developed from a 1981-82 work-in-progress composition called 'James Lincoln Dear'\n13 Unreleased studio outtake.\n14 Unreleased studio outtake.\n15 Compelling song. Features a dark, brooding beat that mirrors the disturbing nature of the lyrics. A nice vocal performance here and we're left wondering what possessed him to write this one.\n16 Add this to the ever expanding list of Bruce's greatest unreleased songs. A man surveys his life and wonders if he can ever escape the demons of his past.\n\n* 'Thrill Hill West' is SpringsteenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home studio in Los Angeles (aka 'Hollywood Hills Garage Studio').\n* Most band tracks are E Street Band backing versions from so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œelectric Nebraska sessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n======================================\n\nOK, so I had already done the 'Born To Run', 'Darkness' &amp; 'The River' outtakes, most BITUSA outtake bootlegs only have 1cd\nand don't include as many different tracks as I'd like to. So I just tried to add all important tracks to the same boot.\nI know, not every outtake is included and that wasn't my intention either.\n\nThe first disc is supposed to be the original track listing of 'Murder Incorporated', the never-released 1983 album which was\n(as you can see/hear) a lot darker than 'Born In The U.S.A.' Also included are the 5 b-sides Bruce had intended to use. (SEE BELOW)\n\nWhen burning this compilation, make sure you burn it DAO - without the 2 seconds gaps between each track.\n\nBig thanks to a few people on SPL (reidneile, jumpstone) - I hope you all enjoy this.\nThis one's dedicated to 'richr' and all his friends over at 'Thunder Road'.\n\nThanks to brucebase &amp; theboots.net for some of the song descriptions.\n\n===============\n\nBy July 1983 Springsteen was in the final stages of mixing and track selection for the album. There was talk of a pre-Christmas release. \nThere was certainly no shortage of outstanding material to pick from. A document exists from mid 1983 revealing SpringsteenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s selection for the BITUSA album, \nas well his selections for b-sides. It was as follows:\n\nBORN IN THE USA\nMURDER INCORPORATED\nDOWNBOUND TRAIN\nGLORY DAYS\nTHIS HARD LAND\nMY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN\nJOHNNY BYE BYE\nFRANKIE\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢M GOIN DOWN\nWORKING ON THE HIGHWAY\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢M ON FIRE\nb-side / SUGARLAND\nb-side / FOLLOW THAT DREAM\nb-side / DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T BACK DOWN\nb-side / ONE LOVE\nb-side / LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac96c32dd7ed5ccb72fd1069c5ea47c6a0f632f","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+1984+-+Unsatisfied+Heart+-+BITUSA+Outtakes+%28EV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac96c32dd7ed5ccb72fd1069c5ea47c6a0f632f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,201,108,50,221,126,213,204,183,47,209,6,156,94,164,124,106,15,99,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
