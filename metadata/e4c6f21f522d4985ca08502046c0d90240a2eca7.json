Boasting collaborative work with The StreetsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mike Skinner, M.I.A associate Diplo, grime faces Terrah Danjah and D Double E, and even producer du jour Paul Epworth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Bloc Party knob-twiddler, who contributes Black Sabbath-sampling rock banger &quot;I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know Why&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this is an album that reflects KanoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charismatic, multi-faced style: or, as he neatly puts it on frothing junglist number &quot;Reload It&quot;, &quot;I make love music/And I make thug music&quot;.\n\nSkipping styles like hopscotch, we see Kano tackle assured, chugging rap-rock (&quot;Typical Me&quot;); Latin-tinged, Hennesy-sipping party vibes (&quot;Remember Me&quot;); reflective garden-gate philosophy (&quot;How We LivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢&quot;); and thuggish, slice-of-London-life drama (Ã¢â‚¬ËœGhetto KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) with equal charm and proficiency. His debut single, &quot;Boys Love Girls&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a bouncy, comical encapsulation of playground sexual politics, included here as a bonus track Ã¢â‚¬â€œ still sounds like perhaps his finest moment. But on Home Sweet Home, Kano has grown in many directions, and somewhat miraculously, every one suits him --Louis Pattison","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c6f21f522d4985ca08502046c0d90240a2eca7","amp;dn":"Kano%3A+Home+Sweet+Home+%5Bby_AyigbeBoy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c6f21f522d4985ca08502046c0d90240a2eca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,198,242,31,82,45,73,133,202,8,80,32,70,192,217,2,64,162,236,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
