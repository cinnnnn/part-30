He also wrote under the pseudonyms George Whitley, George Whitely, Andrew Dunstan, and S.H.M.Chandler wrote over 40 novels and 200 works of short fiction. He was most well known for his John Grimes novels and for the Rim World series, which have a distinctly naval flavour. He won Ditmar Awards for the short story The Bitter Pill (in 1971) and for three novels False Fatherland (in 1969), The Bitter Pill (in 1975), and The Big Black Mark (in 1976).\nChandler's descriptions of life aboard spaceships and the relationships between members of the crew en route carry a feeling of realism rarely found in other writers, and obviously derive from his experience on board seagoing ships. Chandler's principal hero, Grimes, is an enthusiastic sailor who has occasional adventures on the oceans of various planets. Chandler made heavy use of the parallel universe plot device throughout his career, with many Grimes stories involving characters briefly crossing over into other realities. In &quot;The Dark Dimensions&quot;, which is set at a point in space where various realities meet, Grimes (the Rim World Commodore), meets not only another John Grimes who is still in the Federation Survey Service, but also the characters from the Empress Irene books and Poul Anderson's Dominic Flandry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27318a7ca2f29c70248d563a730223c30e89fe18","amp;dn":"Bertram+Chandler%27s+Collection+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27318a7ca2f29c70248d563a730223c30e89fe18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,49,138,124,162,242,156,112,36,141,86,58,115,2,35,195,14,137,254,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
