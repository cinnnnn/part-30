This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;In the rock era, has there ever been a recording act who achieved Billboard's number one record-of-the-year more than once?&quot; Casey says it's happened twice.\n\nSteve Martin (The Jerk, Little Shop Of Horrors, Pink Panther) is at number 17 with his hit &quot;King Tut.&quot;\n\nOne group in the countdown has a member who once scored points with his girlfriend by making a recording star out of her little brother. He wrote a number one song for the kid and Casey gives the details.\n\nTwo songs in the countdown are by an act that comes from a family which (as of August 1978) has cumulatively occupied the number one spot on the singles chart more than any other family in the rock era; 34 weeks (nearly eight months).\n\nOne listener wants to know, &quot;What recording act had the record that reached the top ten the fastest during the rock era?&quot; Casey lists three acts that debuted on the top 40 in the top 10, and one of those did it three times.\n\n40:    Close The Door - Teddy Pendergrass\n39:    Just What I Needed - The Cars\n38:    Runaway - Jefferson Starship        \n37:    The Groove Line - Heatwave     \n36:    YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re A Part Of Me - Gene Cotton With Kim Carnes     \n35:    Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra    \n34:    Reminiscing - Little River Band\n33:    Rivers Of Babylon - Boney M\n32:    Love Is In The Air - John Paul Young\n31:    Macho Man - Village People\n30:    Two Tickets To Paradise - Eddie Money\n29:    Got To Get You Into My Life - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire    \n28:    You And I - Rick James\n27:    You - Rita Coolidge\n26:    Stuff Like That - Quincy Jones\n25:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Had Enough - Wings\n24:    Hot Child In The City - Nick Gilder\n23:    Still The Same - Bob Seger\n22:    Use Ta Be My Girl - OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Jays\n21:    Fool If You Think ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Over - Chrie Rea\n20:    Stay - Jackson Browne\n19:    Shame - Evelyn Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChampagneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ King\n18:    Kiss You All Over - Exile\n17:    King Tut - Steve Martin\n16:    Baker Street - Gerry Rafferty\n15:    Shadow Dancing - Andy Gibb\n14:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n13:    My Angel Baby - Toby Beau\n12:    LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Been Good - Joe Walsh\n11:    Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John\n10:    An Everlasting Love - Andy Gibb\n9:    Magnet And Steel - Walter Egan\n8:    Copacabana - Barry Manilow\n7:    Love Will Find A Way - Pablo Cruise\n6:    Boogie Oogie Oogie - A Taste Of Honey\n5:    Hot Blooded - Foreigner\n4:    Miss You - The Rolling Stones\n3:    Last Dance - Donna Summer\n2:    Grease - Frankie Valli\n1:    Three Times A Lady - The Commodores\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bb20571cf2318b49fae7f99e20c6742dd14f1c0","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_August_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bb20571cf2318b49fae7f99e20c6742dd14f1c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,178,5,113,207,35,24,180,159,174,127,153,226,12,103,66,221,20,241,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
