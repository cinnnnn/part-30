Strutting the streets of London in his Lord Nelson tricorn hat, like the time-travelling veteran of some early nineteenth century war, Ant has battled mental illness, sectioning and public acrimony. Many who casually followed Ant on UK television may have recalled a greying, t-shirt-and-suit sporting fellow who seemed more &quot;Manager of Deutschebank&quot; than &quot;Wild King of Deutschegirls&quot;. Ant's attempts to appear as a wine-bar crooner, inoffensively and uninterestingly attired, drove his fans away like vampires from garlic. \n\n=== Screens ===\n\n\n\n\n=== Attention Please ===\n\nThis movie can be watched on TV,PC,tablets and phones with high quality.\n\nIf you have any problems with video/audio , Please update K Lite Mega Codec pack.\n\nTested on MPC,VLC,PS 3,PSP,XBOX 360,iTunes,ipad2,ipad mini,iphone 4/5S,Samsung Galaxy S5,Samsung/LG/Vestel/SONY Smart TV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dac94e510cd7a43661f86a6419561c6257223ad","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Black+Hussar+2013+1080p+BluRay+x264+AAC+-+Ozlem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dac94e510cd7a43661f86a6419561c6257223ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,172,148,229,16,205,122,67,102,31,134,166,65,149,97,198,37,114,35,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
