But this was a hard damn sync! So their maybe still some spots where go oos but it will come back.\nThanks to our good guy in PrisM l0ck for his hard work on syncing the monster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3a1bb626f5525b70764412b3179ebf2ff6571b","amp;dn":"Splice.R5.CAM.AUDIO.READNFO.XviD-+PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3a1bb626f5525b70764412b3179ebf2ff6571b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,58,27,182,38,245,82,91,112,118,68,18,179,23,158,191,47,246,87,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
