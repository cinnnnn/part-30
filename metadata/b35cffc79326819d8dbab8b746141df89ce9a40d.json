Most of them are still unidentified after all the work my associates and I did. What we learned in the process has to do with the power, and also the weakness, of scientific methodology, with the limitations of technical analysis, and with the very nature of our fears and our biases as scientists facing the unknown. It is a process that teaches us a new measure of humility before the universe and its bewildering potential to reveal alien forms of consciousness and, more importantly perhaps, new insights into our own. But my immediate conclusion is this: whatever else they may be, UFOs represent a technology capable of harmful actions. This observation should send us back into the field with better resources and a renewed sense of urgencey.&quot;\n\n\nScanned document in PDF format (requires Adobe Acrobat).
