This two disc set is pretty extensive featuring tracks all the way back to &amp;#039;80. The 24 page full color booklet includes liner notes about each song, written by Iron Maiden&amp;#039;s manager and long time friend Rod Smallwood. This made for an interesting read even before I put the CD into the deck. The booklet also includes shots of all the different album covers from the various singles that the tracks were taken from. Lots of killer tracks included on this disc, many of which were released in the Castle 2-CD re-issues in 1995. However, it&amp;#039;s nice to have all these rare tracks on one disc. Of particular interest to me are the many cover songs. Two Montrose tracks &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got the Fire&quot; and &quot;Space Station No. 5&quot;, Jethro Tull-&quot;Cross Eyed Mary&quot;, Beckett-&quot;A Rainbow&amp;#039;s Gold&quot;, Nektar &quot;King of Twilight&quot;, Marshall Fury-&quot;Juanita&quot;, Stray-&quot;All In Your Mind&quot;, Golden Earring &quot;Kill Me Ce Soir&quot;, Free-&quot;I&amp;#039;m A Mover,&quot; Led Zeppelin-&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, Budgie- &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t See My Feelings&quot;, The Who-&quot;My Generation&quot; and UFO&amp;#039;s &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;. On top of this there are some live rarities and studio outtakes. My only complaint is that Maiden&amp;#039;s most awesome cover ever was left off; Thin Lizzy&amp;#039;s &quot;Massacre.&quot; Oh well, guess you can&amp;#039;t have everything. &quot;Cross Eyed Mary&quot; is still among my favorite Iron Maiden covers of all time. The liner notes state that despite the fact that this song was never released as a single, it is one of the few song to gain radio airplay in the U.S. when it was released as the b-side to &quot;The Trooper&quot; in &amp;#039;83. Apparently, because of this, the record company executives tried to convince Steve Harris to release the song as a single. Steve refused on the grounds that the track did not really represent the band&amp;#039;s sound.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41cfc1fe1efa802268336a3180b268b2c665199e","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Best+Of+The+B%5C%27Sides+CD1+%28Eddie%5C%27s+Archive+CD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41cfc1fe1efa802268336a3180b268b2c665199e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,207,193,254,30,250,128,34,104,51,106,49,128,178,104,178,198,101,25,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
