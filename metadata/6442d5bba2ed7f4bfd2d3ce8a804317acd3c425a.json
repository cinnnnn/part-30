For more information on Samantha Mumba please read about her on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Mumba\n\nI have made the best discography that I can. Sorry but there isn't much for her, just 1 main album and 1 main compilation. She didn't do much in the pop world but what she did was pretty cool. There was a few versions of her album entitled &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;. I have included the best one which was more recent and had the most tracks on, the European version which was a more updated version of her album. It has the extra bonus tracks on the end, the earlier releases didn't have as many especially the primary release.\n\nBoth of these I have ripped them correctly and converted into MP3 CBR 320kbps/44.1Khz. I have also included the covers, the front and back for each one.\n\nI'm not sure if anybody has ever done a Samantha Mumba discography before? Maybe I am the first, it's possible nobody has ever thought about making it before. These rips are from originals, not copies and they are the best quality I can make.\n\nPlease if you do download this then you might want to help to seed it a bit and pass around to others. I have made sure that it's a quality release for you and worth sharing. This is all you need from the artist. Hope you enjoy listening to this music.\n\nFormat: MP3 CBR\nQuality: 320kbps/44.1Khz\nTotal Tracks: 33\nDuration: 2:04:18\nEncoder: LAME3.97\nTotal Size: 307 MB\nCovers: Front &amp; Back\n\nReleases as follows:\n\n(2001) Samantha Mumba - Gotta Tell You\n(2006) Samantha Mumba - The Collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6442d5bba2ed7f4bfd2d3ce8a804317acd3c425a","amp;dn":"Samantha+Mumba+-+Discography+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6442d5bba2ed7f4bfd2d3ce8a804317acd3c425a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,66,213,187,162,237,127,75,253,45,60,232,168,4,49,122,205,60,66,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
