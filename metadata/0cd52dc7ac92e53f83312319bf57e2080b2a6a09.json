Their philosophies were miles apart - Reagan intent on scaling back government, O'Neill fervent in defending it. Yet there was common ground too: long lunches shared on St. PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day and a mutual respect - political and personal. Three days after ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shooting, Tip was the first outsider at the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bedside.\n\nDrawing not only on his own remarkable knowledge but on extensive interviews with those closest to his subjects, Matthews brings this unlikely friendship to life in his unique voice, rendering as lively and novelistic a listen as Jack Kennedy and a timely object lesson in how bipartisan cooperation can work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd52dc7ac92e53f83312319bf57e2080b2a6a09","amp;dn":"Tip+and+the+Gipper+When+Politics+Worked+Chris+Matthews+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd52dc7ac92e53f83312319bf57e2080b2a6a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,213,45,199,172,146,229,63,131,49,35,25,191,87,226,8,11,42,106,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
