ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no bad thing either; with the grandiose wail of Godspeed and the heart and soul of Fairport Convention the band are on to something really special, and coming from the LOAF camp you know youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for a delicious treat. Somehow thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very defiant British streak to Ã¢â‚¬ËœDead Legs &amp; AlibisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and deep beneath the gorgeous production and noisier elements thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a record that even my dad could hold near and dear. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for the life of me work out why more people arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listening to Dark Captain instead of plumping for arch-twats Mumford and Sons, but then the world isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t very fair, is it now? Well good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:827062265ae3a91853b625ddd2ab311c20a26fed","amp;dn":"Dark+Captain+-+Dead+Legs+%26amp%3B+Alibis+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"827062265ae3a91853b625ddd2ab311c20a26fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,112,98,38,90,227,169,24,83,182,37,221,210,171,49,28,32,162,111,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
