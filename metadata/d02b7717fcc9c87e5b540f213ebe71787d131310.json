Each of the chronologically arranged entries focuses on a specific historical event, analyzing its roots, socio-economical context, sequence and consequences. Readers can visit familiar uprisings like the Boston Tea Party, while discovering lesser-known events such as the Mauritanian Rebellion in fourth-century Africa, the Marriage Aid Protest in medieval France and the 1765 Rebellion of the Barrios in Ecuador.\nA separate A-to-Z biographical section introduces revolt leaders, activists and other personalities that make up the full and often painful, history of taxation. The text is enhanced by over 60 illustrations, including photographs and political cartoons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02b7717fcc9c87e5b540f213ebe71787d131310","amp;dn":"A+World+History+of+Tax+Rebellions.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02b7717fcc9c87e5b540f213ebe71787d131310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,43,119,23,252,201,200,126,91,84,15,33,62,190,113,120,125,19,19,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
