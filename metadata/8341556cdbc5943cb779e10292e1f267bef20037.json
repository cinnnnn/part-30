The game combines spectacular fights with roleplay elements in single player or co-op mode.\n \nBlood Knights has been developed by German studio Deck 13, who are famous for their wonderful, plot-driven games such as Venetica, Jack Keane and Ankh.\nThe thrilling story of Templars and vampires plays out against a backdrop of a mystical version of the Middle Ages. In an act of desperation, the legendary vampire hunter, Jeremy, is forced into a blood-bond with the deadly vampiress, Alysa. Together, the two enemies are the last hope to restore the balance of the world.\n \nFormerly arch enemies, they must now fight alongside each other to lift the curse placed on them, and will face numerous dangers along the way. The co-operative multiplayer mode for two players enables you solve problems in different ways using a range of tactics. Intriguing in-game cutscenes relate the story and maintain a tense and thrilling atmosphere throughout!\n\nGame Info:\n***********\nPreCracked - Just Install and Play\nRePacked by: Foxy Games\nReleaded: 2013\nGenere: Action/Adventure/RPG\nSize: 1.9 Gb\nPlatform: PC\n\nInstructions:\n**************\n1.Download - 2.Install - 3.Play and Have Fun - 4.Keep Seeding!\n\nScreenshots:\n*************  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/zNgc3UPeV0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/zNgc3UPeV0.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/i9efpkFhaj.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/i9efpkFhaj.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/28ZWsqUD4V.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://yuq.me/users/23/145/28ZWsqUD4V.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8341556cdbc5943cb779e10292e1f267bef20037","amp;dn":"Blood+Knights+%5B2013+-+PC%5D+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8341556cdbc5943cb779e10292e1f267bef20037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,65,85,108,219,197,148,60,183,121,225,2,146,225,242,103,190,242,0,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
