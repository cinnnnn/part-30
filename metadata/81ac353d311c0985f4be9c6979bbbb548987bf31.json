He's the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.Even though Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce--and goes out of his way to make that very clear--she can't let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, she has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret . . . even if it kills her.Dangerously exciting and darkly romantic, Fallen is a page turning thriller and the ultimate love story.From the Hardcover edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ac353d311c0985f4be9c6979bbbb548987bf31","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Fallen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ac353d311c0985f4be9c6979bbbb548987bf31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,172,53,61,49,28,9,133,244,190,156,105,121,187,187,84,137,135,191,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
