Thousands died here, many of them buried where they fell. Three soldiers are discovered. One is British but a lack of material evidence prevents identification. The other two are German, discovered with tantalizing clues as to their identity. One soldier took into battle a touching souvenir of home, a pictorial shoe polish lid. He also broke a cardinal rule of war by scratching his name on his i.d. tag. The partial name and the keepsake allow a positive identification. The other was found with a matted lump of paper. Using real world &quot;CSI&quot; techniques, a lost document is restored and gives up a name and a place. In the end, enlisted man and officer- brothers only in death-are reburied together in a military cemetery, sharing a single stone.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2081 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.517:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:47.520\nNumber Of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2384ab5ac170804e55b3f077f0c45accd19d0f1","amp;dn":"DC+Finding+the+Fallen+2of5+Serre+1915+Brothers+in+Death+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2384ab5ac170804e55b3f077f0c45accd19d0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,56,74,181,172,23,8,4,229,91,63,7,127,12,69,172,205,25,208,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
