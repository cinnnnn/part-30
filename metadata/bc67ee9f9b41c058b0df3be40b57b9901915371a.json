Now, on the heels of the prestigious award, Lynch has prepared her highly awaited Compass debut DEAR SISTER.\n\nThe album showcases Lynch and her razor sharp band (Mark Schatz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, Matt Wingate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, mandolin, Bryan McDowell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fiddle, mandolin, guitar) on a rock-solid, 10 song set of bluegrassy folk and Americana. Standouts include Ã¢â‚¬Å“DoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (with Tim OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Brien on vocals and bouzouki), the title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear SisterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€an anthemic ballad of the Civil War written by Lynch and Louisa Branscomb based on recently discovered historic letters written by a relative of LouisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the eve of the battle of StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RiverÃ¢â‚¬â€and the Pierce Pettis penned Ã¢â‚¬Å“That Kind of Love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Taken as a whole, the songs constitute what is possibly ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most personal record to date and certainly one of the most broadly accessible albums of her storied career.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A sterling, silvery vocal presence and a gift for supple, emotional ornamentationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦LynchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent is a diamondÃ¢â‚¬Â¦gorgeous voice and sense of purpose, supported by (a) superb ensemble.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Claire Lynch has a] gift for molding lyrics to melody...lovely, deftly austereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The Boston Globe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc67ee9f9b41c058b0df3be40b57b9901915371a","amp;dn":"Claire+Lynch+-+Dear+Sister+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2CLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc67ee9f9b41c058b0df3be40b57b9901915371a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,103,238,159,155,65,192,88,176,223,59,228,11,87,185,144,25,21,55,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
