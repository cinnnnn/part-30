She rummaged the aisles at a music store, selected all kinds of classic tunes and albums by singers/songwriters, and got the idea to make a CD of cover songs. She picked her album tunes not because they were famous, but because she enjoyed the songs. Some she had been familiar with for years and others were more recent finds, but either way, she wanted to expose a new generation to these great songs.\nThis special edition includes a DVD with bonus footage including the video for album's premiere release Have a Little Faith in Me, beautifully illustrated with photographs as the singer walks along, and the video for Drop the Pilot, which was supposed to be the first release.\n\nI cannot help but crack up the volume as soon as the album begins, because it starts off with a bang: Senses Working Overtime. It is catchy and it has excellent harmonies and background vocals. It blends right into the next track, The Whole of the Moon, which is lyrically amazing and ends with a superb echo effect. Can We Still Be Friends slows things down a bit, only to be sped up by I Feel the Earth Move, which feels very &quot;live&quot; yet disco. Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters, another ballad, is heartfelt. Drop the Pilot is one of my favorite tracks on the album, rock meets pop, energy meets emotion. Moonshadow is light and sweet, aided by plucky guitar. Dare I say that I like her version of One Way or Another as much as the original? As with the other songs, it is great to hear a familiar song sung by someone who is not attempting to sound exactly like the original singer. Likewise, Anticipation is good and slow with twang, as it should be. I enjoy how full Help Me sounds with the brass section and background vocals.\nMandy's voice has matured a great deal over the past few years. You can tell and hear that she loves music, and it loves her right back. From start to finish, a great testament to well-written songs and a great listen for adults and teens alike. This album is sure to widen her audience.[/quote]\n \n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/D4CfniZMYL.png[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Mandy Moore - Coverage\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Mandy Moore\nAlbum................: Coverage\nGenre................: \nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: \nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
