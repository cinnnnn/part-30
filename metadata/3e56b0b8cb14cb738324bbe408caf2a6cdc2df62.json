At the time, he was, as all the janissaries were, kidnapped from his Bulgarian family, raised as a Muslim, trained to be a ferocious warrior and convert infidels to Islam in a most brutal way. His cruelty stuns even local Ottoman ruler. He stops at nothing but the resistance of some of the locals is invincible. The struggle is half a success, there are many converts, the death toll is heavy, but all the Bulgarian keep their language and traditions on.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e56b0b8cb14cb738324bbe408caf2a6cdc2df62","amp;dn":"Vreme+razdelno+%2F+Vreme+Na+Nasilie+%2F+Time+of+Violence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e56b0b8cb14cb738324bbe408caf2a6cdc2df62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,86,176,184,203,20,203,115,131,36,187,228,8,202,242,166,205,194,223,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
