Wells\nGuests: Maurice Cotterell, Russ Baker\n\nEngineer and scientist Maurice Cotterell discussed astrology and the effects of the sunspot cycle on human personality and behavior, as well as other topics from his book, FutureScience.\n\nTwitter Censorship\n\nIn the first hour, investigative reporter Russ Baker commented on Twitter\\'s announcement ( http://whowhatwhy.com/2012/02/02/close-reading-the-saudis-a-twitter-investment-and-the-end-of-arab-spring/ ) about restricting tweets in countries where the government declares the tweets illegal. Essentially, their decision means that in some nations people will not be allowed free expression via Twitter, he explained. Baker suggested that the new censorship ruling may be due in part to Twitter\\'s relationship with a wealthy Saudi prince, who recently bought a large stake in the company and has a clear agenda in restricting tweets. Baker also explained about how Israel may act as America\\'s fall guy in a possible forthcoming conflict with Iran.\n\nWebsite(s):\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://mauricecotterell.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://mauricecotterell.com&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://russbaker.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://russbaker.com&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://whowhatwhy.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://whowhatwhy.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBook(s):\n\n    FutureScience\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://mauricecotterell.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://mauricecotterell.com&lt;/a&gt;\n    \n    The Mayan Prophecies: Unlocking the Secrets of a Lost Civilization\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852309067/c2cam-20)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852309067/c2cam-20)&lt;/a&gt;\n    \n    Family of Secrets  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Family-Secrets-Americas-Invisible-Government/dp/1608190064/c2cam-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Family-Secrets-Americas-Invisible-Government/dp/1608190064/c2cam-20&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBecome A Coast Insider: http://www.coasttocoastam.com/coastinsider","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbf08c8508edd3ff7438a0615a3b4fcadb99f6f7","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+2012.02.04+Chinese+Astrology+%26amp%3B+Sunspots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbf08c8508edd3ff7438a0615a3b4fcadb99f6f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,240,140,133,8,237,211,255,116,56,160,97,90,59,79,202,219,153,246,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
