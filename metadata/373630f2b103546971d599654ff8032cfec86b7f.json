It will also cover the\nbasics of networking and cryptography required to understand the fundamental\nworkings of port knocking systems and the threats and attacks pertinent to\nthem. An overview of both port knocking and single packet authorization and\nthe security aspects involved, including the debated topic of security through\nobscurity, will enable a clearer understanding of port knocking in actual use\nand the analysis of implementations of both forms of firewall authentication\nschemes.\nThe aim of this thesis is to analyse the security offered by both systems\nand assess which threats exist in theory and in the real world, and outline\nthe practicalities of using port knocking as part of defence in depth. Finally,\nthis thesis attempts to mention certain possible improvements to port knocking\nschemes, as well as an overview of alternate uses of port knocking in other\naspects of information security.\nThe two primary implementations that will be analysed are Martin Krzy-\nwinskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Port Knocking Perl Prototype and Michael RashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single packet autho-\nrization Firewall Knock Operator (fwknop). In actual use, it was found that the\nPerl Prototype may be more restrictive due to the long Ã¢â‚¬ËœknocksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ required when\nencryption is used, and anti-replay features require that state be maintained on\nboth the server and client. The extremely low transmission rate and delivery-\norder issues involved with port knocking make it less suitable where more data\nmay be required for a secure and practical knock. On the other hand, the sin-\ngle packet authorization implementation, fwknop, uses single UDP packets to\ntransmit authorization data, much in the fashion described in ISO/IEC 9798-\n2 on entity authentication, but loses the Ã¢â‚¬ËœknockingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aspect of port knocking,\nwhich is a novel and unique delivery mechanism. In its default configuration,\nfwknop is quite vulnerable to dictionary attacks, simply due to the way in which\npassphrases are turned into cryptographic keys. A will present a simple tool,\nfwknop da, designed to illustrate how a live attacker could intercept fwknop\nauthorization packets and crack them.
