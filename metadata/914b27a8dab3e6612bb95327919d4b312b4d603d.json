The Assads were seen as a glamorous couple with modern Western morals and values; he was hailed a reformer, she was the 'Rose of the Desert'.\n\nKey leaders and figures in the West welcomed the young couple, convinced that the softly spoken London-trained ophthalmologist and his beautiful British-born former investment banker wife would bring reform and modernisation to a country that had been run by an iron-fisted dictator for nearly 30 years.\n\nBut it seems the West was duped. Instead of a transparent and progressive leadership, what has emerged during a year-long bloody uprising is evidence of the regime's gross systematic human rights abuses, including widespread killings and torture, while the Assads look on.\n\nChannel 4 Dispatches investigates the extent of the Assad family's culpability and the chains of command that link the President and select inner circle to the brutal crackdown.\n\n\nFile: Dispatches.S26E05.The.Real.Mr.and.Mrs.Assad.avi\n\nSource : http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=198238\nUpped by tarunp\n\nshunster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:914b27a8dab3e6612bb95327919d4b312b4d603d","amp;dn":"Dispatches+-+The+Real+Mr+and+Mrs+Assad+2012+06+06+Ch4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"914b27a8dab3e6612bb95327919d4b312b4d603d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,75,39,168,218,179,230,97,43,185,83,39,145,157,75,49,43,77,96,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
