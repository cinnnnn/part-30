Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, the film portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It stars Jesse Eisenberg as founder Mark Zuckerberg, along with Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake as the other principals involved in the website's creation. Neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project, although Eduardo Saverin was a consultant for Mezrich's book.[3] The film was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 1, 2010.\n\nThe film received widespread acclaim, with critics praising it for its editing, acting, score and screenplay. Some people, including Zuckerberg himself, criticized the film for its many inaccuracies. The Social Network appeared on 78 critics' top 10 list for 2010; of those critics 22 had the film in their number one spot. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said &quot;The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.&quot; It received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Fincher), and Best Actor (Eisenberg) and won three for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing. It also won the Best Motion Picture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drama Golden Globe at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. The film also won Golden Globe awards for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score, making it the film with the most wins of the night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Social Network 2010\n\n\nThe Social Network is a dark ambient soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for David Fincher's film of the same name. It was released on September 28, 2010.[1] On September 17, a five-track sampler was also made available for free.[2] The film's score bears a similar sound to the previous Reznor/Ross 2008 collaboration, Ghosts I-IV, and even features two slightly reworked tracks from Ghosts. (The track &quot;Magnetic&quot; is reworked from &quot;14 Ghosts II&quot;, and &quot;A Familiar Taste&quot; is a remix of &quot;35 Ghosts IV&quot;.)\n\nCritical reception of the soundtrack has been generally favorable, with high praise and widespread acclaim across the film industry being bestowed upon it. The score won nine major awards, including the 2010 Golden Globe award for Best Original Score ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Motion Picture,[3] and the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hand Covers Bruise&quot; \n2.\t&quot;In Motion&quot; (Accidentally received the note 'interpolation of 35 Ghosts IV', which was intended for &quot;A Familiar Taste&quot;)\n3.\t&quot;A Familiar Taste&quot; \n4.\t&quot;It Catches Up with You&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Intriguing Possibilities&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Painted Sun in Abstract&quot; \n7.\t&quot;3:14 Every Night&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Pieces Form the Whole&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Carbon Prevails&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Eventually We Find Our Way&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Penetration&quot; \n12.\t&quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; (Edvard Grieg)\n13.\t&quot;On We March&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Magnetic&quot; \n15.\t&quot;Almost Home&quot; \n16.\t&quot;Hand Covers Bruise, Reprise&quot; \n17.\t&quot;Complication with Optimistic Outcome&quot; \n18.\t&quot;The Gentle Hum of Anxiety&quot; \n19.\t&quot;Soft Trees Break the Fall&quot;\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffe7623666a1c85cb985f36ff5786e40bfa2313","amp;dn":"The+Social+Network+-+Trent+Reznor+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffe7623666a1c85cb985f36ff5786e40bfa2313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,254,118,35,102,106,28,133,203,152,95,54,255,87,134,228,11,250,35,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
