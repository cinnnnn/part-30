Java developers have been particularly     :\n : fortunate in this area, having been able to take advantage of Grails, an   :\n : open source framework that supercharges productivity when building         :\n : Java-driven web sites. Grails is based on Groovy, which is a very popular  :\n : and growing dynamic scripting language for Java developers and was inspired:\n : by Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.                                            :\n :                                                                            :\n : Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon is the first introductory book on the :\n : Groovy language and its primary web framework, Grails.  Griffon is also    :\n : covered. While Grails is the Web framework for building Groovy Web         :\n : applications, Griffon is the deskop framework for building desktop Groovy  :\n : applications.  Could Groovy be the new Java?  It's light, fast and free    :\n : (open source).                                                             :\n :                                                                            :\n : This book gets you started with Groovy, Grails and Griffon, and culminates :\n : in the example and possible application of some real-world projects.
