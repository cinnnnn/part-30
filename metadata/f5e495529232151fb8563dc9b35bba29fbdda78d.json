HÃƒÂ©ctor looks at the forest behind their house with binoculars, when he sees someone who turns out to be a young woman undressing. His wife leaves to go shopping so he investigates, only to be stabbed and chased by a mysterious man wearing pink bandages on his face. After fleeing and breaking into a mysterious building, HÃƒÂ©ctor is contacted by a scientist (Nacho Vigalondo), who warns him of the bandaged man and guides him to his location, promising safety. The scientist convinces HÃƒÂ©ctor to hide from the bandaged man in a large mechanical device. However, when he leaves the machine, he discovers that he has traveled several hours back in time. \n\nIMDB Link - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/\nWikipedia Link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timecrimes\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : C:Timecrimes-Hover_manTruecrimes.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 946 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 435 Kbps\nMovie name                               : TIMECRIMES\nGenre                                    : Mystery\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.46.100\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : No\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : 20\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 1 300 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.149\nStream size                              : 857 MiB (91%)\nWriting library                          : Lavc54.79.100\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 84.4 MiB (9%)\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this movie.
