You can build your own house anywhere in the world! Team up with your friends and build a village or city and repel attacks by other players who want to steal your lands and slaughter your cattle! A good castle with a moat and tall city walls might help you protect yourselves and your precious cattle. \n\nThe combat system in our game is quite unique. It is a no target and physics-based combat system. The direction of your attack depends on mouse movement. Basic movements combined with directional attacks can be mixed together into deadly combos with special effects. Battle formations are a new way to collaborate and control the situation on the battlefield with your fighting team. Depending on the battle situation, a group leader must issue the right commands to manage formations during a battle. The more group members that make up a given formation the bigger the advantages they enjoy. A well organised group will always prevail over a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off.\n\n=================================\nFeatures RePack: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not cut | Do not recoded \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Game Version - v.1.0 \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Installation time ~ 2-5 minutes. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ RePack by MAXAGENT \nWARNING !!!
