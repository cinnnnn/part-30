Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc9784ab24c994bc85737037edf07f2e358ef3b","amp;dn":"French+Postimpressionism+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc9784ab24c994bc85737037edf07f2e358ef3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,201,120,74,178,76,153,75,200,87,55,3,126,223,7,242,227,88,239,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
