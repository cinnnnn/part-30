If you user your computer every day, you need protection that's always there, constantly keeping you safe. With AVG Anti-Virus, you get hassie-free protection against today's most sophisticated threats, online and offline. AVG Anti-Virus includes a unique LinkScanner to prevent you from accidentally visiting harmful sites. It's faster, smarter security that won't slow you down. AVG Anti-Virus is one of the most complete programs we have found to date. It includes many new options to make it one of the most effective viruis scanners on the market. It is still plajued by horrible slowdowens at times. Even things so simple as just typing an IM can be stopped for several seconds for some reason. If you can get passed the occasional slowdowns of your computer, the scanning functionality of AVG Anti-Virus is top of the line. With the rewrite of the scanning engine, AVG includes multi-processor support.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomizable installation\r\n\r\nThe setup procedure is reasonably fast, AVG gives users the possibility of excluding any components from the installer when it comes to the E-mail Protection, Identity, Web Browsing, Firewall and PC Analyzer components (along with additional languages aside from English).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe E-mail Shield handles incoming and outgoing E-mails for SPAM and other malicious activity, while the Identity Module monitors the behavior of all running processes to determine whether they intend to steal the user's identity or not. PC Analyzer is a *bonus feature that scans the computer for registyry errors, junk files and broken shortcuts.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern and user-friendly interface\r\n\r\nAVG keeps the same interface in all three products of it's lineup, adopting a predominantly green theme and flat look. Large buttons provide immediate access to all primary components and users may easily go back and forth through each panel. An important aspect worth taking into account is that it is possible to explore Internet Security even when it's busy with a task.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple scanning methods and rich customization settings\r\n\r\nDifferent levels of scanning can be run, depending on the user's preferences. The factory configuration is set with optimized settings by AVG's own recommendations, but advanced users are free to tinker with these options in detail, such as PUP and Spyware Reports, Archives, Tracking Cookies, File Exceptions, Rootkit Detection, Heuristics, Scan Priority Level (to favor either speed or resources consumption) and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance and conclusion\r\n\r\nUsers ma decide for themselves whether they want the AV Utility to be quick or thorough, as well as to pick speed over resources usage or the other way around. When it comes to malware protection ratio and scanning speed, Internet Security does not disappoint. Overall, users probably find the app's extra layers of security to their liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes &amp; Improvements (released version 01-12-2015):\r\n\r\n- Implemented AVG Outlook plugin support for Office 2016. \r\n\r\n- Fixed issue with an occasional crash during avgns process initialization. \r\n\r\n- Fixed issue with MS Excel crash after sending XLS document via Outlook. \r\n\r\n- Email Scanner's warning about encrypted traffic is displayed only once per an email client run. \r\n\r\n- Better Windows Safe Mode Scan dialog with the new &quot;Quick scan&quot; option. \r\n\r\n- Fixed issue with memory use in IDP agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis torrent contains:\r\n\r\n- AVG Anti-Virus 2016 x86 &amp; x64\r\n\r\n- AVG Internet Security 2016 x86 &amp; x64\r\n\r\n- Latest virus definitions\r\n\r\n- Key Maker\r\n\r\n- Serials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ac32f2573780825811ca5868923da03dc81cb32","amp;dn":"AVG+Internet+Security+2016+16.0+Build+7294+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ac32f2573780825811ca5868923da03dc81cb32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,195,47,37,115,120,8,37,129,28,165,134,137,35,218,3,220,129,203,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
