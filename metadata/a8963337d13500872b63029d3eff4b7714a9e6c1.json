They try to explain the mistake to the cruel commanders that do not accept their explanations. When the prisoners decide to help the charismatic Captain Alfred Dreyfus to escape, Doug and Tony try to tell them that this is a doomed plan since Dreyfus has never escaped from the hellish island.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8963337d13500872b63029d3eff4b7714a9e6c1","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+Devil%27s+Island+Ep.+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8963337d13500872b63029d3eff4b7714a9e6c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,150,51,55,209,53,0,135,43,99,2,157,62,255,75,119,20,169,230,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
