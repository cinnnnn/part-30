His wife Lucy is seven months pregnant with their first child. They have a wonderful home, and are deeply in love.\nThey have everything they could hope forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until they lose it all in one horrifying moment.\nOn a bright, sunny day, Sam receives a call from Lucy while heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at work. She tells him to leave the building immediately. He doesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦just before it explodes, killing everyone inside. Lucy vanishes, and Sam wakes up in a prison cell. As the lone survivor of the attack, he is branded by the CIA as a murderer and a traitor.\n\nEscaping from the agency, Sam launches into a desperate hunt to save his kidnapped wife and child, and to reveal the unknown enemy who has set him up and stolen his family. But the destruction of SamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life was only step one in an extraordinary plotÃ¢â‚¬â€and now Sam must become a new kind of hero.\n\n\n\n                          Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                          Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n        **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n           Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n              &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68dbebd21485a3048e383fdb1b85b6567ba278b","amp;dn":"Adrenaline+by+Jeff+Abbott+%28Sam+Capra+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68dbebd21485a3048e383fdb1b85b6567ba278b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,141,190,189,33,72,90,48,72,227,131,253,177,184,91,101,103,186,39,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
