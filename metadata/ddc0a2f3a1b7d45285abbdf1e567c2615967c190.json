In it the prophet Almustafa discusses the entire gamut of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences with his hearers: life, and death; marriage, and children; prayer, love, hope and God.\n\nEach new topic is introduced as a discourse between Almustafa and a questioner. As he answers, Almustafa uses a unique combination of: vivid imagery, moving allegory, and revealing insight to instruct his hearers.\n\nThe resulting narrative is profoundly moving as it illuminates some of the deepest longings, fears, and motivations of mankind.\n\n\n** Download contains:\n\nPDF version of the book\n\nand\n\nAudiobook\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc0a2f3a1b7d45285abbdf1e567c2615967c190","amp;dn":"Kahlil_Gibran_The_Prophet_%7BShockwave%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc0a2f3a1b7d45285abbdf1e567c2615967c190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,192,162,243,161,183,212,82,133,171,189,241,229,103,194,97,89,103,193,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
