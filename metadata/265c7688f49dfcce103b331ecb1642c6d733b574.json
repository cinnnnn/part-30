ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Book of Taliesyn', was the only record cover John Vernon Lord ever designed and according to the artist's recent retrospective the original artwork was never returned.\n\nThe brief from the artist's agent is detailed in Drawing upon Drawing as follows:\n\n&quot;the agent gave me the title saying that the art director wanted a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“fantasy Arthurian touchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and to include hand lettering for the title and the musiciansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ names. I mainly drew from The Book of Taliesin, which is a collection of poems, said to be written by the sixth century Welsh bard Taliesin.&quot;\n\nThe fee for the job was Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£30 (minus 25% for the agent). John Vernon Lord was until recently, Professor of Illustration at the University of Brighton.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRod Evans - lead vocals \nRitchie Blackmore - guitar \nNick Simper - bass, backing vocals \nJon Lord - Hammond organ, keyboards, string arrangements on &quot;Anthem&quot; \nIan Paice - drums \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265c7688f49dfcce103b331ecb1642c6d733b574","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+%5C%27The+Book+Of+Taliesyn+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265c7688f49dfcce103b331ecb1642c6d733b574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,92,118,136,244,157,252,206,16,59,51,30,203,22,66,198,215,51,181,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
