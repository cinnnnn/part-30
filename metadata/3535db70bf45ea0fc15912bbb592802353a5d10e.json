But what if Ã¢â‚¬Å“machinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like automobiles, bicycles, health monitors, appliances, instruments, and anything else you can connect to the Internet, could all become members of your social network, collect data you care about, and feed it back to you at just the right time? Nike+ is already doing this for your body, but every major industry, from healthcare to cars to home construction, is now building sensors and digital connectivity into their next generation of products.\n\nCompanies like Ford, Pepsi, Verizon, and Procter and Gamble are also using Ã¢â‚¬Å“social machinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to reach new markets, improve brand/market awareness, and increase revenues.

The next stage of interaction between people and our environment is upon us.\n\nOur online interactions form the backbone of companies likeand Twitter and have redefined how we communicate. But what if machines like vehicles, health monitors, and appliances could all become members of your social network and share important information with you about what's happening in your automobile, your home, and your body? Well, the future is already here.\n\nSocial machines use everything from tiny, low-cost sensors to powerful embedded computers to securely gather valuable data from a growing collection of connected devicesÃ¢â‚¬â€cars, fitness trackers, irrigation systems, power meters, hospital beds, and many more. These machines communicate this data over the Internet to social networks of people and machines who can respond to a problem, deliver a service, or sell a solution. Nike, Ford, Procter &amp; Gamble, and others are already using this technology to develop the next generation of Internet-enabled products and services that will drive the next wave of worldwide product innovation. Consider what's already out there:\n\nNike's Nike+ shoe sensors can communicate with a smartphone app, which becomes your fitness guru, motivator, and record keeper\nP&amp;G and Walmart collaborated on a &quot;social vending machine&quot; that instantly distributes free samples of Cascade dish soap when customers use their smartphones to &quot;like&quot; the Cascade page on\nA Dutch start-up uses wireless sensors on cattle that send a message to farmers when an animal is sick or pregnant\nA wireless heart monitor from Corventis can text a physician when a patient's heart palpitates\nSocial machines are the next big thing. Experts predict that an estimated 50 billion products will be sharing data over the Internet by 2020. Social Machines is the first book to explain the benefits and the process of connecting machines to a social network and bringing these products to a mass market. It shares step-by-step guidance on how to learn from existing implementations and customize them for your own use.\n\nWho says only humans can be social? &quot;Social&quot; creates a compelling new business model for the Internet of Things.
