Others thought him a mere crank, a man who was interested only in publicizing himself by putting forward his often unwelcome opinions on every conceivable issue and question.\r\nIn this pictorial biography Margaret Shenfield gives a concise picture of the  whole Shawâ€”the dramatist and the borough  councillor, the sage and the crank, the man and the institution. The text covers  the whole range of his activities in the  theatre, in politics, and in private life, his writings, friends, and loves. The combination of an authoritative text  and over a hundred carefully chosen and skilfully integrated photographs of Shavian people, places, manuscripts, and  letters make this one of the most intriguing and stimulating books on Shaw  ever published","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f63e0f2ff1865c06a8fdaab18793e41a45bc19","amp;dn":"Bernard+Shaw+-+a+Pictorial+biography+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f63e0f2ff1865c06a8fdaab18793e41a45bc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,246,62,15,47,241,134,92,6,168,253,170,177,135,147,228,26,69,188,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
