The evening began with Warren by himself performing Glory Road and Affair On 8th Ave. Danny then came aboard and the two of them delivered a memorable Broken Promised Land. The full band then started in with Get Behind The Mule and a riveting Raven Black Night. I'll Be The One featured a tease of Blue Sky and Afro-Blue was a great lead-in to Bus Stop. The set ended with a first time showing of Nirvana's About A Girl that left the crowd speechless.\n\nWarren and Danny started the second set with a glorious telling of Hallelujah. They were then joined by Matt and Jorgen for The Shape I'm In. The blues came to the temple in the form of I Belive To My Soul and It Hurts Me Too. Matt took the helm with Drums that led into Child Of The Earth and a stunning Sugaree. Thorazine Shuffle rounded out the set, but Warren responded to the cheers and returned to the stage to deliver a solo performance of Forevermore. Again, due to hearty applause, the full Mule came on stage and proffered a first timer, Where Did You Sleep to end the night. \n\nTRACKLIST [FLAC]\n\nDISC ONE\n1. Glory Road\n2.
