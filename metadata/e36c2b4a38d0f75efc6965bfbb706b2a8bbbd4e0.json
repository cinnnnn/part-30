The brash and often insulting new coach is intent on inspiring these underdogs not only to win, but also to stand-up for themselves. Although his coaching tactics may be unorthodox, including motivating his star player with a pre-game stripper, his heart is in the right place. Besides, sometimes it takes big balls to play hard-ball.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nTennis Anyone?: The Making Of\nDeleted Scenes\nOuttakes\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
