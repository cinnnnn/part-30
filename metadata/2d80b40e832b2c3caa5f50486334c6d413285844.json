Layton. Two voices that defined Iron Man come together to tell the untold story of his most dire hour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Armor Wars 2!\n\nWriter: David Michelinie\nArtists: David Ross, Bob Layton\nCover Artist: David Ross\n\nPublished: May 01, 2013\n\n------\n\nThis miniseries is shipping 4 times this month, as 258.1 to 258.4\n\nI think this is like the X-Men Forever series, with the old writer returning to tell a story picking up right after he left the book. In this case, the late 1980's. (Many fans know Marvel already did &quot;Armor Wars II&quot;, with Byrne writing and Romita Jr. penciling.)\n\nIt's disappointing that Layton's only inking this. --STFmaryville","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d80b40e832b2c3caa5f50486334c6d413285844","amp;dn":"IRON+MAN+258.1+%282013%29+%28Marvel%29+%28Digital%29+%28Roxrite-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d80b40e832b2c3caa5f50486334c6d413285844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,128,180,14,131,43,44,60,170,95,80,72,99,52,198,212,19,40,88,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
