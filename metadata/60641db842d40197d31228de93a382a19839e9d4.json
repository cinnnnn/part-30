Dynex doesn&amp;#039;t have the driver to download on its website, and the driver CD comes with a bunch of bloatware and crap no one wants. I extracted this driver myself, so it&amp;#039;s barebones and it works perfectly. \n\nTo install, extract the rar to a folder on your desktop, then install your new hardware using the &quot;have disk&quot; option, select the &quot;dynex webcam&quot; folder, and select the &quot;OEM7&quot; file. You&amp;#039;ll be good to go.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60641db842d40197d31228de93a382a19839e9d4","amp;dn":"Dynex+DX-DTCAM+Web+Camera+Driver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60641db842d40197d31228de93a382a19839e9d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,100,29,184,66,212,1,151,211,18,40,222,147,163,130,161,152,57,233,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
