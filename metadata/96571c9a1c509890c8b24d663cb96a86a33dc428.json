There&amp;#039;s over 1740 of them in one rar-package. Hope that you&amp;#039;ll like it... :))\n\nThe full list of games included is just too long to put right here so it&amp;#039;s downloadable at : http://www.mediafire.com/?yingpbnjtnn\n\nMost of the games requires DOSBox to run correctly in modern PC&amp;#039;s. DOSBox is freeware and I strongly recommend to download it from : http://www.downloadsource.net/2788/DOSBox/\n\nI&amp;#039;m seeding this one as often and as long as I possibly can. If you&amp;#039;re downloading; SEED IT, please and THX! :)\n\nCONTAINS NO VIRUSES OR MALWARE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96571c9a1c509890c8b24d663cb96a86a33dc428","amp;dn":"Oldies+but+Goldies+-+1740%2B+Classic+DOS+%26+Windows+games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96571c9a1c509890c8b24d663cb96a86a33dc428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,87,28,154,28,80,152,144,200,178,77,102,60,185,106,134,163,61,196,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
