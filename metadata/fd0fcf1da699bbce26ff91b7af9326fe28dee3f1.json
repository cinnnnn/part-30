He has received classical music training, and was influenced early-on by the work of jazz drummers Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Appice is best known for his associations with Vanilla Fudge, Cactus, the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice, Rod Stewart, King Kobra, and Blue Murder, which also featured John Sykes of Thin Lizzy fame, and Tony Franklin of The Firm.\n\nAppice is credited with influencing several drummers including Nicko McBrain; Aerosmith's Joey Kramer; Roger Taylor of Queen; Phil Collins of Genesis; Rush's Neil Peart; Motley Crue's Tommy Lee; Dave Lombardo; Richard Christy; Chris Grainger; David Kinkade; Ray Mehlbaum; Led Zeppelin's John Bonham; Robb Reiner; and, Eric Singer.\n\nHis best-selling drum instruction book The Realistic Rock Drum Method was first published in 1972, and has since been revised and republished as The Ultimate Realistic Rock Drum Method. It covers the basic subjects of rock rhythms and polyrhythms, linear rudiments and groupings, shuffle rhythms, hi-hat, and double bass drum exercises.\n\nOf Italian descent, Appice is the older brother of drummer Vinny Appice by 11 years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVincent Paul &quot;Vinny&quot; Appice (born September 13, 1957), is an American rock drummer and the younger brother of drummer Carmine Appice. He is best known for his work with the bands Dio, Black Sabbath, Heaven &amp; Hell, and Big Noize.\n\nAppice took up the drums at the age of nine, taking lessons from the same teacher as his brother Carmine. When he was sixteen, Appice and his band BOMF met John Lennon at Record Plant Studios, leading to him appearing on several Lennon recordings. He moved on to record with Rick Derringer on Derringer (1976), Sweet Evil (1977), and Derringer Live (1977), before forming his own band Axis and recording It's A Circus World (1978).\n\nAppice joined Black Sabbath during the tour in support of the Heaven and Hell album in 1980. He was quickly brought in to replace original drummer Bill Ward, who quit the band mid-tour due to personal issues. Appice arrived for his first show with Black Sabbath at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii with his entire drum kit packed into the back of a car. He was forced to learn the band's songs on stage, using hastily written crib notes for each unfamiliar song. A sudden rain storm made the ink run on Vinny's notes. According to an interview conducted at NAMM in 2012, Vinny stated that at the end of the show during the bows he tossed the notebook into the crowd. Appice subsequently appeared on the Black Sabbath albums Mob Rules (1981) and Live Evil (1982).\n\nIn late 1982 he left Black Sabbath along with vocalist Ronnie James Dio and formed the band Dio. They recorded Holy Diver (1983), The Last in Line (1984), Sacred Heart (1985), Intermission (1986), and Dream Evil (1987). In December 1989 Appice left Dio and briefly teamed up with Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson in the band Flesh &amp; Blood.\n\nAppice joined World War III In 1990 and in 1992 he returned to Black Sabbath for the Dehumanizer album and tour. &quot;I like Vinny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he's a nice chap,&quot; Tony Iommi reflected to the Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. &quot;Vinny was asked to continue with the Sabbath thing, but he didn't. I like Vinny's playing.&quot;Appice rejoined Dio and they recorded Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996).\n\nPrior to the 1996 tour, Appice played drums for Las VegasÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased guitarist, Raven Storm, on his album The Storm Project, which also involved long-time Dio engineer and producer, Angelo Arcuri. Arcuri was also a childhood friend of the Appice brothers.\n\nIn 2005 Appice appeared on a rap recording by Circle of Tyrants, whose lineup included Necro, Ill Bill, Goretex, and Mr Hyde, also collaborating with Alex Skolnick. Appice played two shows in Las Vegas with the Sin City Sinners in October 2009. Appice rejoined his Black Sabbath bandmates Ronnie James Dio, Geezer Butler, and Tony Iommi in 2006 as Heaven &amp; Hell, touring and releasing one studio album, The Devil You Know, before Dio's death in 2010.\n\nHe is currently participating in &quot;Drum Wars&quot; shows with his brother Carmine, which feature a guest appearance from vocalist Paul Shortino.\n\nAppice formed the band Kill Devil Hill with former Down and Pantera bassist Rex Brown, guitar slinger Mark Zavon and lead vocalist Dewey Bragg. Kill Devil HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled debut album was released May 22, 2012, via Steamhammer/SPV and landed at #9 on the Billboard Top New Artist Albums (HeatSeekers) Chart, #41 on the Top Hard Music Chart and #50 on the Independent Album Chart.\n\nIn January 2013 the Italian band Martiria has announced that Vinny Appice will record the drum tracks for their new album (release expected for late 2013). Vinny had already worked in 2006 with two of Martiria's members: the guitarist-composer Andy Menario and the lyricist Marco Roberto Capelli, while recording the CD Dinosaurs, together with Carl Sentance, Carlos Cavazo and Jeff Pilson.\n\nOn November 25, 2013, it was announced that Appice had formed a new band called WAMI, which features vocalist Doogie White, bassist Marco Mendoza, and 16-year-old Polish guitarist Iggy Gwadera. On February 12, 2014, the upcoming album title was revealed to be Kill the King, due for release in the spring. On February 25, the album cover and track listing were revealed.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, it was announced that Appice had left Kill Devil Hill, and that former Type O Negative drummer Johnny Kelly was his replacement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0fcf1da699bbce26ff91b7af9326fe28dee3f1","amp;dn":"Carmine+%26amp%3B+Vinny+Appice+-+Drum+Wars+Live%21+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0fcf1da699bbce26ff91b7af9326fe28dee3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,15,207,29,166,153,187,206,38,255,145,183,175,147,38,254,40,222,227,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
