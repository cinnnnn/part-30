Its border with Afghanistan extends over 1,000 miles and is the likely hideout of Osama bin Laden. Yet it is the linchpin in the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ war on terror, receiving over $10 billion of American aid since 2001 and purchasing more than $5 billion of U.S. weaponry in 2006 alone.\n\nWith unilateral incursions into Pakistan by U.S. troops pursuing Taliban fighters, and surveys indicating that more than seventy percent of Pakistanis fear America as a military threat, relations between the two countries remain tense. The scion of a famous Punjabi political family, with extraordinary contacts inside the country and internationally, Tariq Ali has long been acknowledged as a leading commentator on Pakistan. In The Duel, he combines deep understanding of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history with extensive firsthand research and unsparing political judgment to weigh the prospects of those contending for power today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f913cab1e38ff87b058a6c53c76e8c1807c69126","amp;dn":"The+Duel%3A+Pakistan+on+the+Flight+Path+of+American+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f913cab1e38ff87b058a6c53c76e8c1807c69126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,19,202,177,227,143,248,123,5,138,108,83,199,110,140,24,7,198,145,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
