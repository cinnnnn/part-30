It was the largest invasion force ever assembled. Over 6,800 ships, landing craft and other vessels were used to get over 130,000 men ashore onto the Normandy beaches. This incredible programme shows it all.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF BRITAIN\n\nThe battle fought over Britain between the 10th July and 31st October 1940 was the most important RAF battle of the entire war. Using Pathe archive material as well as rarely seen colour footage of LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blitz, this programme tells the blow-by-blow story of the desperately close-run conflict that was the death or glory battle fought in the skies over Britain.\n\nBRITISH BATTLES OF WORLD WAR II\n\nAlthough British forces went into action at the very outset of the Second World War in 1939, it was not until 1940 that the land war began. But this was the beginning of a period of constant defeat. First, Norway, then the Low Countries and finally France. Fortunately it was all to change as this informative and entertaining programme documents.\n\nTHE LONG YEARS 1942-1944\n\nAs the war entered the third year, a period of retrenchment began as Britain settled down for a long, hard slog. The cinema played a vital role in not only recruiting woman in some kind of war work but also in encouraging the British people to do their bit for the war effort. This programme illustrates the Home Front efforts as seen through the cinemas at the time.\n\nTHE VICTORY YEARS 1944-1945\n\nAs the Allies prepared for the invasion of France, on the home front there was an invasion of a very different kind. The G.I.s had arrived, sweeping many a young girl off her feet. Then came D-Day followed by HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final terror weapon, the Doodlebug. But, Britain could take it and victory in Europe was followed by victory in Japan.\n\nTHE BLITZ YEARS 1939-1941\n\nAt the end of 1939, Britain was plunged into the most brutal war ever fought. British PathÃƒÂ© News has interwoven the memories of the young men and women left behind in Britain with the newsreel of the day to create Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Blitz YearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a lasting tribute to the spirit of the Home Front.\n\n345 min approx.\n\nVideo; x264; 704*576 (4:3); 1789 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a5d7c5e9a7fc7a72370fdd5fdd3892ffa2e7064","amp;dn":"Britain+at+War+6+DVD+Set+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a5d7c5e9a7fc7a72370fdd5fdd3892ffa2e7064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,93,124,94,154,127,199,167,35,112,253,213,253,211,137,47,250,46,112,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
