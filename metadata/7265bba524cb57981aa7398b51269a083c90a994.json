Emma McEvoy considers some of the origins of Gothic tourism and discusses Gothic itself as a touristic mode. Through studies of ghost walks, scare attractions, Dennis Severs' House, Madame Tussaud's, the Necrobus, castles, prison museums, phantasmagoria shows, the 'Gothick' design of Elizabeth Percy at Alnwick Castle, a party at Fonthill Abbey, and a poison garden, McEvoy examines Gothic tourism in relation to literature, film, folklore, heritage management, arts programming, and the 'edutainment' business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7265bba524cb57981aa7398b51269a083c90a994","amp;dn":"Gothic+Tourism+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7265bba524cb57981aa7398b51269a083c90a994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,101,187,165,36,203,87,152,26,167,57,139,81,38,154,8,60,144,169,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
