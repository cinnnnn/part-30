Since then, TSO has gone on to sell nearly 8 million concert tickets and 8.5 million albums. The band's musical style incorporates classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into hard rock and heavy metal. The band is most famous for their series of rock operas (Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, and The Lost Christmas Eve), for which they do an annual fall/winter tour. Their other releases are rock operas on historical themes (Beethoven's Last Night and Night Castle). Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which are complete with a full orchestra, a massive light show, lasers, dozens of pyrotechnics, moving trusses, video screens, and other effects that are synchronized to the music. Despite the name, the group has no connection to Siberia or any part of Russia\n\n.: Trans-Siberian Orchestra Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img177.imageshack.us/img177/5381/wallpaper101024600nz4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img177.imageshack.us/img177/5381/wallpaper101024600nz4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nChristmas Eve and Other Stories (1996)\nThe Christmas Attic (1998)\nBeethoven's Last Night (2000)\nThe Lost Christmas Eve (2004)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd116984bdd488e3a1b7eb04b4b89d3c475fdb40","amp;dn":"Trans+Siberian+Orchestra+-+Discography+1996-2004+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd116984bdd488e3a1b7eb04b4b89d3c475fdb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,17,105,132,189,212,136,227,161,183,235,4,180,184,157,60,71,95,219,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
