Follow the lost lives of people who are savagely torn apart by events beyond their control: The innocent world of an imaginative little girl is shattered when she witnesses a brutal double murder. An introverted young boy on the verge of manhood gets a lesson on just how far is too far when he falls for a needy woman who lives life in the fast lane. Or party with a pair of low-rent hoods who learn what is really important in life just when they shouldn't. And even learn the story of the most infamous gangster who ever lived, Amy Racecar, who talks to God, lunches with the President, and just may be responsible for the end of the world. These are some of the tales that will rip out your guts and break your heart.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comcis)] - Local (Brian Wood) (Oni Press) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8818431&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8818431&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comcis)] - The Bronx Kill (Vertigo) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8801799&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8801799&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAny questions?
