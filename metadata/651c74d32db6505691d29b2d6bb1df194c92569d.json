A fixture of the pop canon, Prince is widely held to be the greatest musician of his generation and will undoubtedly remain an inspiring and singular talent. \r\n\r\nThis meticulously researched biography is the most comprehensive work on Prince yet published. Unlike other Prince books, this one eschews speculation into the artist's highly guarded private life and instead focuses deep and sustained attention exactly where it should be: on his work. Acclaimed British novelist and critic Matt Thorne draws on years of research and dozens of interviews with Prince's intimate associates (many of whom have never spoken on record before) to examine every phase of the musician's 35-year career, including nearly every song released and unreleased that Prince has recorded. \r\n\r\nOriginally released in the UK in 2012, this first US publication of &quot;Prince&quot; includes updated content detailing the artist's two 2014 albums, tour, 2015 Tidal release, and other career events. \r\nThis astonishingly rich, almost encyclopedic biography is a must-have for any serious fan of Prince.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651c74d32db6505691d29b2d6bb1df194c92569d","amp;dn":"Prince+-+The+Man+and+His+Music+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651c74d32db6505691d29b2d6bb1df194c92569d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,28,116,211,45,182,80,86,145,210,155,45,107,177,223,25,76,146,86,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
