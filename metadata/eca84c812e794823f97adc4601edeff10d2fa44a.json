Did Supreme Court sell out America's citizens in the nineteenth century, with consequences lasting to this day? Is there a way for American citizens to recover democracy of, by, and for the people?\n\nThom Hartmann takes on these most difficult questions and tells a startling story that will forever change your understanding of American history. Amongst a deep historical context, Hartmann describes the history of the Fourteenth Amendment--created at the end of the Civil War to grant basic rights to freed slaves--and how it has been used by lawyers representing corporate interests to extend additional rights to businesses far more frequently than to freed slaves. Prior to 1886, corporations were referred to in U.S. law as &quot;artificial persons.&quot; But in 1886, after a series of cases brought by lawyers representing the expanding railroad interests, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations were &quot;persons&quot; and entitled to the same rights granted to people under the Bill of Rights. Since this ruling, America has lost the legal structures that allowed for people to control corporate behavior.\n\nIt's time for &quot;we, the people&quot; to take back our lives. In this revised and expanded second edition, Hartmann incorporates specific examples from today's headlines, and proposes specific legal remedies that could truly save the world from political, economic, and ecological disaster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eca84c812e794823f97adc4601edeff10d2fa44a","amp;dn":"Unequal+Protection%3A+How+Corporations+Became+%26quot%3BPeople%26quot%3B+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eca84c812e794823f97adc4601edeff10d2fa44a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,168,76,129,46,121,72,35,249,122,220,70,1,237,239,241,13,47,164,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
