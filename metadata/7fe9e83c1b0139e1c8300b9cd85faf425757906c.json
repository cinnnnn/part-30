For those whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve managed to stumble across central TennesseeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-kept secret, though, albums like Feral Fire are fine examples of Southern rock shot through with bar-band abandon, twang, and ruminations on life, love, and lust in a small town. The lineup has changed considerably since 1998, when Southern by the Grace of Location introduced Glossary as contemporaries of Centro-Matic and Lucero. Frontman Joey Kneiser is still in the driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat, and he steers the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound like Patterson HoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger brother -- not as interested in southern folklore, perhaps, but just as focused on the characters that inhabit the region. Like the title suggests, Feral Fire is full of muscled, guitar-heavy rock songs, most of them spinning stories of heartbroken narrators and hungover mornings. But the real highlight here -- the one that makes Feral Fire one of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best albums yet -- is a stunning ballad named Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sweet Forever,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ proof that Glossary don't need decibels to make an impression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe9e83c1b0139e1c8300b9cd85faf425757906c","amp;dn":"Glossary+-+Feral+Fire+%5B2009%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe9e83c1b0139e1c8300b9cd85faf425757906c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,233,232,60,27,1,57,225,200,48,11,156,216,95,175,66,87,87,144,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
