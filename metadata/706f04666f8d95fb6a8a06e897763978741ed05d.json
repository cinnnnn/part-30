The emphasis is on helping the reader in understanding and constructing proofs and writing clear mathematics. This is achieved by exploring set theory, combinatorics and number theory, topics which include many fundamental ideas which are part of the tool kit of any mathematician. This material illustrates how familiar ideas can be formulated rigorously, provides examples demonstrating a wide range of basic methods of proof, and includes some of the classic proofs. The book presents mathematics as a continually developing subject. Material meeting the needs of readers from a wide range of backgrounds is included. Over 250 problems include questions to interest and challenge the most able student as well as plenty of routine exercises to help familiarize the reader with the basic ideas.\n\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload. Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology.

We are a free school in Nicaragua that needs help to stay alive. \n\n\nDonate here https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=AVP8RK3DQ7UUU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706f04666f8d95fb6a8a06e897763978741ed05d","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Mathematical+Reasoning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706f04666f8d95fb6a8a06e897763978741ed05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,111,4,102,111,141,149,251,106,138,6,232,151,118,57,120,116,30,208,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
