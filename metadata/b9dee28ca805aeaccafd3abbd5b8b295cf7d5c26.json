It was a labor of Love.  Bob holds a very special place in my heart for many reasons.  I wanted to share this music with people whose only exposure to Bob was the album &quot;Legend&quot;.   It is some of my favorite songs from every studio album arranged chronologically.  Long before torrent file sharing began I was passing along this disc of music to people to play in their DVD players or computers.  Now, every car stereo, boom box, etc. recognizes CDR's with MP3 files!  How times change....\n\nI would have loved to create this torrent in FLAC but that format wasn't even around when I put this collection together and my intent was to be able to share, on a cd, the music.  What I did do, however, was &quot;re-record&quot; this collection. I am a self-proclaimed &quot;Audiophile&quot; and have been fortunate enough to acquire a pretty decent Hi-Fi.  I used cd's released on the Tuff Gong label (unfortuneately I don't own everything on vinyl!) and used the following equipment to re-record them:\nTheta Pearl transport &gt; Kimber Illuminations D60 cable &gt; GW Labs DSP &gt; Kimber Illuminations D60 cable &gt; MSB Gold Link III DAC/P1000 power supply &gt; Cardas Quad Link 5C cables &gt; Linn LK1 preamp &gt; Cardas Quad Link 5C cables &gt; Pioneer PDR 609 CD recorder\nBy re-clocking the digital signal and upsampling the bit rate I think the end result is a more analog sound..... but that's just one man's opinion yah kno?\n\n1.\tCONCRETE JUNGLE                 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCATCH A FIREÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                          \n2.\tSLAVE DRIVER                                                 \n3.\tSTOP THAT TRAIN\n4.\tBABY WEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢VE GOT A DATE\n5.\tSTIR IT UP\n6.\tHIGH TIDE OR LOW TIDE\n7.\tALL DAY ALL NIGHT\n8.\tGET UP, STAND UP                ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBURNINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                                         \n9.\tI SHOT THE SHERIFF\n10.\tPUT IT ON                                                                                           \n11.\tSMALL AXE\n12.\tPASS IT ON\n13.\tDUPPY CONQUEROR\n14.\tONE FOUNDATION\n15.\tLIVELY UP YOURSELF              ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNATTY DREADÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                   \n16.\tTHEM BELLY FULL\n17.\tSO JAH SEH\n18.\tNATTY DREAD\n19.\tTALKINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ BLUES                   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTALKINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ BLUESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                              \n20.\tAM A DO\n21.\tBEND DOWN LOW\n22.\tREBEL MUSIC                     ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œREBEL MUSICÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                                     \n23.\tRAT RACE\n24.\tROOTS\n25.\tPOSITIVE VIBRATION              ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRASTAMAN VIBRATIONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                   \n26.\tROOTS, ROCK, REGGAE\n27.\tCRY TO ME\n28.\tWANT MORE\n29.\tCRAZY BALD HEAD\n30.\tNATURAL MYSTIC                  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEXODUSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                                      \n31.\tTHE HEATHEN\n32.\tEXODUS\n33.\tJAMMING\n34.\tWAITING IN VAIN\n35.\tTHREE LITTLE BIRDS\n36.\tONE LOVE\n37.\tEASY SKANKING                   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKAYAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                                        \t    \n38.\tKAYA\t\n39.\tIS THIS LOVE\n40.\tSUN IS SHINING\n41.\tSATISFY MY SOUL\n42.\tSHEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S GONE\n43.\tSO MUCH TROUBLE IN THE WORLD    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSURVIVALÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                               \n44.\tZIMBABWE\n45.\tAFRICA UNITE\n46.\tONE DROP\n47.\tAMBUSH IN THE NIGHT\n48.\tCOMING IN FROM THE COLD         ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUPRISINGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                                              \n49.\tBAD CARD\n50.\tCOULD YOU BE LOVED\n51.\tREDEMPTION SONG\n52.\tCHANT DOWN  BABYLON             ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCONFRONTATIONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½                                    \t                                 \n53.\tBUFFALO SOLDIER\n54.\tJUMP NYABINGHI\n55.\tGIVE THANKS AND PRAISES\n56.\tBLACKMAN REDEMPTION\n57.\tTRENCHTOWN\n58.\tRASTAMAN LIVE UP!\n59.\tBURNINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ AND LOOTINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢           \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLIVE AT THE RECORD PLANT: 1973ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n60.\tKINKY REGGAE\n61.\tGET UP, STAND UP\n62.\tSLAVE DRIVER\n63.\tWALK THE PROUD LAND\n64.\tYOU CANÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T BLAME THE YOUTH\n65.\tRASTAMAN CHANT\n\n\nSongs 1-58 are 256kps and 59-65 are 320kps.  My God, tracks 60-61 will make your hair tingle....\nFor those of you casually interested in Bob I think this is a great way to get exposed to more than what you might have already heard.  For those of us who have made his music part of the fabric of our Lives,  rip this to CD, hit &quot;random play&quot;, and SMILE!\nThis is my first torrent, so I welcome constructive feedback.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9dee28ca805aeaccafd3abbd5b8b295cf7d5c26","amp;dn":"BOB+MARLEY+%26+THE+WAILORS+Best+Of+%28upsampled%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9dee28ca805aeaccafd3abbd5b8b295cf7d5c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,222,226,140,168,5,174,172,202,253,58,187,213,184,178,149,207,125,92,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
