Pascale Bussieres is also worth seeing - she did a great performance in Ma Vie en Cinemascope. No English subtitles... maybe someone can find some. I have more Lanctot if people show an interest in this one.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is NOT the 1993 Japanese movie... you have been warned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbcd41decdd0fc9731648e423d5c376a455a662","amp;dn":"Sonatine+%28Micheline+Lanctot%2C+1984%29+No+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bbcd41decdd0fc9731648e423d5c376a455a662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,188,212,29,236,221,15,201,115,22,72,228,35,213,195,118,164,85,166,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
