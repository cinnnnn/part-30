We have often been asked when Nave would be available on other platforms. This new Nave brings that notable Nave sound engine to your favourite DAW.\r\n\r\nDesigners have optimized its spectacular graphical user interface to work with the tried-and-tested computer combo of keyboard and mouse (or track pad) rather than touch screen surface technology, yet nothing has been lost in translation.\r\n\r\nThe featured-packed Nave comes pre-packed with superb sounds, ranging from spatial pads to vivid wavetable scans and cutting leads to solid basses, but, above and beyond that, also an abundance of incredibly imaginative sound worlds â€“ many of them professionally produced by some of the top sound designers around.\r\n\r\nblades beschnittenAs a synthesizer thoroughbred at heart, Nave really represents a phenomenal playground for sound creation creativity. Its oscillators offer expanded wavetable functionality with elaborate editing facilities and an extremely effective speech synthesizer.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nInstall and Enjoy!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXV (11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2b342983aa29e1903b4813a03fd3630eda1ed0","amp;dn":"Waldorf+Nave+v1.12+FiXED+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2b342983aa29e1903b4813a03fd3630eda1ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,43,52,41,131,170,41,225,144,59,72,19,160,63,211,99,14,218,30,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
