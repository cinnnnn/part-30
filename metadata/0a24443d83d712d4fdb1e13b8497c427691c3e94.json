Recorded in the band's own Slave Pit Studios with award-winning producer Glen Robinson, the largely conceptual album should please longtime fans of the venerable mutants, while offering newbies a solid slab of hard-hitting, modern monster metal that's sure to send them back into the group's considerable archives in search of another fix.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TJLLGGk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TJLLGGk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a24443d83d712d4fdb1e13b8497c427691c3e94","amp;dn":"GWAR+-+Battle+Maximus+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a24443d83d712d4fdb1e13b8497c427691c3e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,36,68,61,131,215,18,212,253,177,225,59,132,151,196,39,105,28,62,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
