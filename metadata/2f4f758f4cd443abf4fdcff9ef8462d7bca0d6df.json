Principally intended for tertiary level inquiry and research, this will be invaluable as a reference work for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as academics inquiring into the study of meaning and meaning relations within languages. As pragmatics is a centrally important and inherently cross-cutting area within linguistics it will therefore be relevant not just for meaning specialists, but for most linguistic audiences.\n\n* Edited by Jacob Mey, a leading pragmatics specialist, and authored by experts\n* The latest trends in the field authoritatively reviewed and interpreted in context of related disciplines.\n* Drawn from the richest, most authoritative, comprehensive and internationally acclaimed reference resource in the linguistics area\n* Compact and affordable single volume reference format\n\n\nHardcover: 1180 pages\nPublisher: Elsevier Science; 2 edition (September 26, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0080962971\nISBN-13: 978-0080962979","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4f758f4cd443abf4fdcff9ef8462d7bca0d6df","amp;dn":"Concise+Encyclopedia+of+Pragmatics%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4f758f4cd443abf4fdcff9ef8462d7bca0d6df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,79,117,143,76,212,67,171,244,253,207,249,239,132,98,215,188,160,214,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
