The most remarkable spiritual leader of India today, is coming for the Asian-Pacific-Weeks to Berlin.\n\nThere is a demand around the globe for the ideas and analysis of the Indian, coming from Bangalore India. In particular from topmanagers, top- politicians and church representatives from Washington to London to Seoul- and in this case Berlin.\n\nHe fascinates Millions during his rare mega appearances in India.\nNearly 5 million people from 150 different countries came to\nBangalore last year to meditate together with Ravi Shankar. \n\nToday he will talk in the Red-City-Hall-Office in Berlin. Already one week\nago the Indian Thinker visited the capital and talked together with\nChief Governor Klaus Wowereit and other high ranking participants and speakers from Germany, Asia and USA during the Urban Sustainability Conference of the Asian-Pacific-Forum in the Red-Maires-Office about the global challenges of the future.\n\nA secret favourite for the peace noble price, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is a hinduistic sage and Guru; he is the founder of the Art of Living Foundation entertaining over 5000 projects in social focal points, present in many countries, celebrating the 25th anniversary.\n\nEastern wise sayings are more and more finding their way to the West. Instead of greed, stress and excessiveness their message is harmony and peace. They reject war and violence.\n\nThe western observer first notices the exterior of Ravi Shankar: the white gown, the flowing hair and the full beard. But to the Indian Master himself exterior characteristics are not the issue, they only distract from the actual goal of a happy live.\n\nAt the present Ravi Shankar is one of the few personalities with full integrity, with an undisputed moral reputation and recognition. When he speaks it has more effect in the world as with many others. There are a handful of people in the world who are in the same way capable of including everybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of\nview when engaging in dialogues with opposite parties, Bishop Tutu Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and sometimes the Pope. There were nearly enough votes for the Noble peace price last year. He ranked third unofficially. For the next years he will be a very hot favourite for the Oslo committee.\n\nIngenious outsider and Good Shepherd\n\nAs ingenious outsider who goes his very one way, he wants to change the world without any kind of dogmas. For that to happen in the first place one would have to change oneself, one would have to learn to control oneself and to learn to help oneself. Not to be governed any more by the outside but inspired by the inside. Ravi Shankar wants to show people this path. He is as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood ShepherdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nbeyond all confessions and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bother anybody with theologicals and indoctrinary, unreasonable demands.\n\nAlready at a young age he received from his home country India the role as spiritual ambassador sealed with the honorary title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSri SriÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (holy, holy), This title is rarely given, only to very deserving spiritual representatives in India. Ravi Shankar appears small, fragile, always smiling, radiating calmness and equanimity, without taking himself too serious. In his eyes all people are the same. He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make any differences and accepts people as they are.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe art is to laugh, no matter what happens,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ravi Shankar recommends. For example when someone feels wrongly accused one shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get provoked, but act composed. Otherwise one would be dependent of the ill - will of the other person. This is the time one should be at ease and rest in oneself. Exactly this ability to be strong from the inside would lead to self-confidence and social\nstrength.\n\nSimplifications can cause hidden dangers\n\nDuring a talk at the Indian Embassy in Berlin, Ravi Shankar was asked by a student to give him an image with which he could explain to his science oriented colleague spiritual realities and the existence of the soul. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Take for example love and joyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Shankar replies. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Love, joy, soul and mind they are not measurable like the body weight or the timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. You would feel it. It would be important to know\nwho one is. But it would also be good to doubt again and again. When asked by a spectator whether he will meet his mother in law again the Indian Guru replied with a mischievous smile: If you really want it, than yesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nThe critical observer wonders whether Ravi Shankar holds on to a too short sighted contemplation of life with his mixture out of Indian monistic Philosophy and western tradition of positive thinking. Total simplification certainly contains a hidden risk too. Certainly Ravi Shankar cannot solve the problems of\nthe world and of humanity with his attitude of composure towards everything ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but he knows that. Ravi Shankar neither holds power nor a high-ranking religious office such as head of a world religion; nor is it a highly philosophical thinker as Hegel or Kant that you encounter; it is a very strong personality.\n\nProminent figures around the world swear by his Yoga and breathing techniques\nIt is fascinating to listen to him, to experience him. Ravi Shankar is open, friendly and approachable.\n\nHe cuddles up to his comfortable sopha of his suite in a big Hotel in Berlin. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBerlin has a lively, particular mind. Maybe the liveliest one in EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, says Ravi Shankar who knows the German capital already for many years. And he should know. He had travelled in over 150 countries to convey his\nteachings of life and the ABC of breathing properly. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGermany has a lot of culture and discipline. India on the other hand embodies joy and human values. A combination of both is desirableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he says.\n\nIn our area Asian spirituality often has an esoteric touch or a tendency of charlatanism. Obviously Ravi Shankar is immune to this kind of accusations and prejudices. Western Doctors confirm his program in particular the breathing techniques to be preventive and having a healing effect (e.g. with diabetes or\nnervous conditions). The Art of Living is being taught continuously in over 150 countries in workshops and seminars. His Yoga.-breath exercises are a real export bestseller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ also with many VIPs around the globe. With many he had talked about war and peace and the healing effect of proper breathing:\n\nHelmut Schmidt, Reinhold Messner or the Dalai Lama, all have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ besides hundreds more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ already participated in Ravi ShankarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seminars.\n\nReligion is the Banana peel and Spirituality is the Banana\nRavi Shankar became officially know through numerous appearances during UN-assemblies and human rights and peace conferences. Without hesitation he denounces the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½turbo-capitalismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the course of globalisation and a more just distribution of goods and money among poor and rich\ncountries. Ravi Shankar stands up for a global dialogue. Without ideological or confessional blinkers\nhe wants to distribute his message of peace and harmony among the people. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI often say that religion\nis the banana peel and spirituality is the banana. The suffering in the world is only because we through\naway the banana and hold on the empty banana peel. We must strengthen the spiritual aspects of our\nlifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nTo the western sins of stress, haste, hectic, excessiveness, arrogance, avarice and envy he opposes\nan open-minded, peaceful and tolerant society, whose main interest is not economic growth and\npolitics but inner calmness, equanimity and the conscious shaping of ones own life. Apart from his\nwords the Indian teacher relies on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSudarshan KriyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a meditative and at the same time, powerful\nbreathing technique. This technique is supposed to relieve stress and tensions and at the same time\nallow for the mental powers to come to the present moment.\nRavi ShankarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intention is to bring fun and joy of life back to those people who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have many\nreasons to smile. This is being addressed through different humanitarian projects and organisations.\nNearly casually the press agent Christoph Glaser mentions the honorary relief efforts during flood\ndisasters, the attack of the World Trade Centre in New York or for the traumatised war victims in the\nKosovo. On a global scale Ravi Shankar initiates relief programs in the health and service sector,\nincluding rehabilitation programs for criminal offenders and drug addicts; he also developed anti-stress\nprograms for politics and management. In India he founded School and Agricultural projects which are\nrecognised by UNICEF.\nEven chaos may have its purpose. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is part of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar has two faces: he embodies the Guru, apparently withdrawn from the world,\nreposing in the self, giving some of his aura and his total self-control to his global community.\nAnd he is a big initiator of campaigns, an organiser with a vision of society and politics. Ravi Shankar\ndoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t only keep a wakeful eye on injustice and worldly problems, but he engages himself actively.\nHe supports numerous aid and development projects, plants trees, liberates entire villages from trash\nand filth and teaches people social responsibility, providing tools for people to help themselves. This\ndistinguishes him from esoteric Gurus and other spiritual leaders. Nothing seems to shake him. He\neven perceives a purpose in chaos. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is part of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Shankar notes. He was again\nnominated by the Norwegian Nobel Peace Price Committee for the Nobel Peace Price. With this\nrecognition he would naturally have more possibilities as a globally renowned personality.\nHe has clear objectives for the future: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeople have more power to follow their own goals and to give\nlove and compassion to others after doing their practise. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I teach. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I travel.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nThe Indian Sage with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstar-appealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is no devious charlatan. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t drive a noble\nlimousine nor does he throw swanky parties but he lives in a very modest way. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe nicest luxury for\nme is when people smileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar will speak today at 15.20 at the Asian Pacific weeks in the Red- City-hall-office.\nThe Person\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar was born Mai 13th 1956 in the south Indian city of Bangalore as a son of a\nrenowned merchant family. At the age of four he was reciting the Bhagavad Gita, sacred scriptures\nthat provide the basis of the Vedic knowledge. The Vedas are the oldest scriptures and songs of India\nand date back to 2000 years prior to our calendar.\nAt the age of eight he already studied classical Vedic literature, out of which the Sanskrit script and\nlanguage developed. At the age of 17 he concluded his studies in modern science. At the end of the\n1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ravi Shankar becomes a student of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and a teacher for transcendental\nmeditation.\nThe Guru\nThe basis for Ravi ShankarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s teachings is spirituality, meditation and the conveying of the Christian\nmessage of love and compassion. 1982 his activities in Bangalore led to the creation of the charitable\nFoundationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Art of LivingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, encompassing all confessions. He started to teach the Art of Living and\nfounded and supported more than 100 schools all over India; education and food free of charge. In\n1986 he received the honorary title of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYogashiromaniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ during the world conference of Yoga in New\nDelhi presented by the Indian President. Beginning 1990 he founded together with the Dalai Lama\n(spiritual leader of the Tibetans) the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInternational Association for Human ValuesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. This organisation\ncooperates with global networks of the United Nations and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s).\nIts main office is seated in Geneva\n\n\nKriya,Sudarshan,Sri,Ravi,Shankar,Ravishankar,Jai,Gurudev,knowledge,higher,wisdom,love,peace,joy,smile,Rishi,\n\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar 's Sudarshan Kriya Does the Magic!\n\nI mean... every one loves Guruji and His amazing knowledge !\n\n\nJai Gurudev!\n:)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artofliving.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artofliving.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iahv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iahv.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.yesplus.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.yesplus.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artoflivingpune.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artoflivingpune.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artoflivingprojects.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artoflivingprojects.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe hope you enjoy being \nTotally Taken Care Of \nBy our beloved Master:\nSri Sri Ravishankar ji!\n\nENJOY!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac37f57b38d4055aa8541a9d1704b32c6b1dc43","amp;dn":"Kriya+-Sri+Sri+Ravishankar+-+Art+of+Living+-Tagesspiegel_2007_en","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac37f57b38d4055aa8541a9d1704b32c6b1dc43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,195,127,87,179,141,64,85,170,133,65,169,209,112,75,50,198,177,220,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
