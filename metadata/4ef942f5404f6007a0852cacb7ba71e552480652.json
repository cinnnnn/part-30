Black Emperor (formerly punctuated Godspeed You Black Emperor!; also referred to as GY!BE) is an avant-garde Canadian post-rock band based in Montreal, Quebec. Formed in 1994, the ensemble has been influential in its genre, with widespread critical acclaim.\n\nWorking on a near orchestral scale, the nine-piece group had been known to use wide dynamic ranges; unusual use of instrumentation and sounds; elongated songs, composed classically, with multiple movements therein; and use of art and visuals in both their album packaging and live performances.\n\nThe band has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003 with no foreseeable plans to reconvene. A misquoted interview in February 2008 reported the band had broken up, but this was later confirmed as false.\n\n\n\n                           _Steffengd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef942f5404f6007a0852cacb7ba71e552480652","amp;dn":"Godspeed+You%21+Black+Emperor+-+VPRO+radio+session+%28RARE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef942f5404f6007a0852cacb7ba71e552480652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,249,66,245,64,79,96,7,160,133,44,172,183,186,113,229,82,72,6,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
