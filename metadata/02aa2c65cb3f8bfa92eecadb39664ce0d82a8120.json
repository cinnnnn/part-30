Snuffy Jenkins, born in 1908, is pretty much credited with &quot;almost&quot; inventing bluegrass 3-finger style banjo. He was a great banjo picker (he could also play claw-hammer style pretty dang good, too), a fine old-time all-around entertainer in the old medicine show style by being sort of a clown and playing a pretty good washboard set-up. Sometime he would play 3-finger and claw-hammer style in the same song.\n\nHomer &quot;Pappy&quot; Sherrill was a fine &quot;pre-bluegrass&quot; fiddler. I say pre-bluegrass meaning he sort of bridged the gap between old-time fiddlin` and bluegrass style.\nAnother artist of note on this lp is Julian &quot;Greasy&quot; Medlin. He was a fine guitar picker and medicine (or even minstrel) style entertainer, performing in make-up sort of in the black-face tradition, except he used white paint instead of black. He favored novelty and parody songs. Greasy and Snuffy teamed up as sort of a novety act and I`m sure was hilarious to see!!\n\nTheir music is sort of &quot;pre-bluegrass&quot;. They were almost too hot on their instruments to be called old-time, but were mabey just a little shy of the &quot;slickness&quot; to be called bluegrass. They had been big radio stars starting in the 30`s playing the different stations as was common then. The were often sponsored by Crazy Water Crystals (if you want to know about Crazy Water Crystals just do a Google search, I`m not going into the colorful history of that on here!!) and were sent by them to play all over the eastern part of the country to play for that sponsor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02aa2c65cb3f8bfa92eecadb39664ce0d82a8120","amp;dn":"Snuffy+Jenkins+%26amp%3B+Pappy+Sherrill+-+Crazy+Water+Barn+Dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02aa2c65cb3f8bfa92eecadb39664ce0d82a8120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,170,44,101,203,63,139,250,146,238,202,219,57,102,76,224,216,42,129,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
