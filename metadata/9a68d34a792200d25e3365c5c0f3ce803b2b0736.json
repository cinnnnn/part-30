Her virginity. Getting rid of it, though, means doing the one thing that scares her the mostÃ¢â‚¬â€letting down her guard with a relative stranger. Which makes her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother Vin FoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offer too tempting to refuse.\n\nVin barely has room in his schedule to turn around, much less worry about Kara and her crazy quest. When she insists on going ahead with a plan that he considers unsafe, though, enough is enough. If she wants to lose it, she can lose it with him. Bonus: he gets to play out his darkest fantasies, slave collar and all.\n\nKara thought dealing with a known entity like sexy-as-sin, controlling-as-hell Vin would smooth the way. But when it comes right down to doing the deed, not even the safety of a costume can fool her demons.\n\nBy then the game has gone too farÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and the consequences could bind them together forever. Or tear them apart at the seams.\n\nWarning: Contains a sexy, brooding Ã¢â‚¬Å“fix youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hero and a heroine who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid of anythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦except Ã¢â‚¬Å“normal.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ More kinky cosplay losts-and-founds than you can shake a riding crop at. WTF Infirmary is booked up; please make an appointment before you read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a68d34a792200d25e3365c5c0f3ce803b2b0736","amp;dn":"Having+Her+%28Lies+We+Tell+%232%29+by+Jackie+Ashenden+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a68d34a792200d25e3365c5c0f3ce803b2b0736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,104,211,74,121,34,0,210,94,51,101,197,192,243,206,128,59,43,7,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
