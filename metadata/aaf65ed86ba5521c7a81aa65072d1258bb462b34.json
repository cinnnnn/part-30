He avoids the usual clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s of the genre and discovers startling truths. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great therapy for anyone who had to endure being young, which I think is pretty much everyone. Above all itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s screamingly funny.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nRichard Thomas, Editor,\nDuluth Reader Weekly\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTopical, thoughtful and sarcastic social commentary without the overt political overtones which are the usual mainstay of the alternative press. Plus, he buys all his clients free drinks at the conventionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ .\nKerry Farley, Publisher,\nDayton CityPaper\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Invisible Life of Poet is without question the greatest comic strip of the modern age - this is not opinion, this is fact. Christopher WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genius is unparalleled in his field, and in all other fields.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nChristopher Wilson, Creator,\nThe Invisible Life of Poet\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf65ed86ba5521c7a81aa65072d1258bb462b34","amp;dn":"Christopher.Wilson-The.Invisible.Life.of.Poet-CoC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf65ed86ba5521c7a81aa65072d1258bb462b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,246,94,216,107,165,82,28,122,129,170,101,7,45,18,88,187,70,43,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
