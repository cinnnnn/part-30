It mostly contains the group's hit singles from the eighties but also mixes in some live staples as well as one new recording. In April 1999, a companion video (featuring music videos and live footage) was released. The album was followed by another compilation, The Best of 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2000, in 2002.\nA limited edition version containing a special B-sides disc was released on the same date as the single-disc version. At the time of release, the official word was that the 2-disc album would be available the first week the album went on sale, then pulled from the stores. While this threat never materialized, it did result in the 2-disc version being in very high demand. Both versions charted in the Billboard 200.\n\nAmazon.com ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Review By Steven Stolder\nOne need hear only the first notes of this collection--the Edge's ringing guitar notes ushering in &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;-to be taken back to 1984: Ronald Reagan and Maggie Thatcher rule the Western world, the L.A. Olympics is the top sports story, and Ms. Pac-Man reigns at arcades. In rock &amp; roll, there's U2 growing in stature with each new title. Even doubters of the Irish lads have to concede that together they formed the one '80s band with the skill and sense of scale to take over the airwaves and concert stages in a decade of diminished expectations. This 15-song '80s best-of assortment (stick around for the hidden track) spans the decade, reaching back to 1980's &quot;I Will Follow,&quot; when Bono and company were peach-fuzzy and earnest as choirboys, and tracking their path through their most glaring misstep, 1988's overblown Rattle and Hum. \n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Pride (In The Name Of Love)\n[02] New Year's Day\n[03] With Or Without You\n[04] I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\n[05] Sunday Bloody Sunday\n[06] Bad\n[07] Where The Streets Have No Name\n[08] I Will Follow\n[09] The Unforgettable Fire\n[10] Sweetest Thing\n[11] Desire\n[12] When Love Comes To Town\n[13] Angel Of Harlem\n[14] All I Want Is You\n\n\t\tDisc 02 - Mp3 Play Time - 01h:05m:29s\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] The Three Sunrises\n[02] Spanish Eyes\n[03] Sweetest Thing\n[04] Love Comes Tumbling\n[05] Bass Trap\n[06] Dancing Barefoot\n[07] Everlasting Love\n[08] Unchained Melody\n[09] Walk To The Water\n[10] Luminous Times (Hold On To Love)\n[11] Hallelujah Here She Comes\n[12] Silver And Gold\n[13] Endless Deep\n[14] A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel\n[15] Trash, Trampoline And The Party Girl\n\n\tDisc 02 - Mp3 Play Time - 00h:59m:46s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 02h:05m:15s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 300mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t---&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 10 November 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; Polygram\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://www.u2.com\t\t\t \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:846a4f09853d9976d1e4afd0ecffacda711a32e8","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Best+Of+1980-1990+And+B-Sides+-+U2+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"846a4f09853d9976d1e4afd0ecffacda711a32e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,106,79,9,133,61,153,118,209,228,175,208,236,255,172,218,113,26,50,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
