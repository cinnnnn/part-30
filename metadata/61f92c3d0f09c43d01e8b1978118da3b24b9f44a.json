It was at this time that essential tracks like &quot;Hush,&quot; &quot;Speed Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹King,&quot; &quot;Black Night,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Smoke On The Water,&quot; were produced. These solid rock staples, plus many more, are prominently displayed on this set. As a bonus, a photo gallery is included on the second disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f92c3d0f09c43d01e8b1978118da3b24b9f44a","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+History+Hits+%26amp%3B+Highlights+%281968_1976%29%282009%292xDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f92c3d0f09c43d01e8b1978118da3b24b9f44a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,249,44,61,15,9,196,61,1,232,177,151,129,24,218,59,36,185,244,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
