Their conflicts and romances are explored, with central figures including Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woollcott. As the decade progressed, they increasingly found themselves drawn apart by literary ambitions, as well as by social issues including the Sacco and Vanzetti case.\n\t\n\nDecember 10, 1987","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a91b35f16067cb58897da0ac47e5710a6c5b14","amp;dn":"The+Ten-Year+Lunch%3B+The+Wit+and+Legend+of+the+Algonquin+Round+Ta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a91b35f16067cb58897da0ac47e5710a6c5b14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,169,27,53,241,96,103,203,88,137,125,160,172,71,229,113,10,108,91,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
