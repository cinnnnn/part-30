Bennett joined FredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band, Essig departed after producing Fred's third album. Eaglesmith's lyrics possessed a harder, political edge on &quot;Indiana Road&quot; [1987]. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was angry about the state of farming in Canada. Mad about my childhood. I put that record out, and nothing happened again.&quot; In the early nineties the market for flowers collapsed. Concurrent with this setback, Fred recalled &quot;I suddenly started getting calls from people saying, &quot;We want you to play. We'll give you $1,000.00 a night.&quot; &quot;Indiana Road&quot; had become a cult recording. Eaglesmith began calling his road band The Flying Squirrels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e8e7c536050cf586248f79db84565998078170","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith+-+Indiana+Road+%5B1987%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e8e7c536050cf586248f79db84565998078170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,232,231,197,54,5,12,245,134,36,143,121,219,132,86,89,152,7,129,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
