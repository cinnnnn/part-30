Johnstone returns with a stirring tale of legendary shootist Frank Morgan. With his Winchester blazing, Morgan races to rescue Cecil and Ben Tolliver from 20 thundering banditos. When his rifle runs dry, Morgan draws his trusty Colt and drops enough desperados to scatter the rest. Does Don Felipe Almanzar lead these marauding vaqueros, as rancher Tolliver believes? Or do they follow the terrifying Black Scorpion?
