With his acclaimed wit and acuity, Thomas Frank answers the riddle by examining his home state, Kansas-a place once famous for its radicalism that now ranks among the nation's most eager participants in the culture wars. Charting what he calls the &quot;thirty-year backlash&quot;-the popular revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment-Frank reveals how conservatism, once a marker of class privilege, became the creed of millions of ordinary Americans.\n\nA brilliant analysis-and funny to boot-What's the Matter with Kansas? is a vivid portrait of an upside-down world where blue-collar patriots recite the Pledge while they strangle their life chances; where small farmers cast their votes for a Wall Street order that will eventually push them off their land; and where a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs has managed to convince the country that it speaks on behalf of the People.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:462a768c37cfb8479c6e6b00af71b9e64ab526d2","amp;dn":"What%27s+the+Matter+With+Kansas+-+Thomas+Frank.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"462a768c37cfb8479c6e6b00af71b9e64ab526d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,42,118,140,55,207,184,71,156,110,107,0,175,113,185,230,74,181,38,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
