It is a double album; album one is a studio album and album two is a live album, featuring extensive jamming by the band and guest fiddle player, Charlie Daniels, on &quot;24 Hours at a Time&quot;. Album two was recorded live at the Performing Arts Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 31, 1974. Toy Caldwell is credited in the liner notes as playing Lead Guitar and Vocals on &quot;Can't You See&quot;, a track that is unlisted in either the cover or the labels. Can't You See was actually recorded at this show, but would be retained for release on the band's following album, Searchin' for a Rainbow in 1975. Album one was recorded in 1974 in Macon, Georgia at Capricorn Studios. There are several guest artists that contributed to seven songs recorded in the studio: Elvin Bishop - slide guitar on &quot;Where a Country Boy Belongs&quot;, Charlie Daniels - fiddle, Earl Ford - trombone, Paul Hornsby - piano, organ and clavinet, Jerry Joseph - conga, Steve Madaio - trumpet, Sam McPhearson - harp, Andy Stein - fiddle, and Johnny Vernazza - slide guitar on &quot;Where a Country Boy Belongs&quot;.\n\nBecause this is a double album, disc one is side one and four, and disc two is side two and three. The reason for this is so that the records may be played in order on those phonograph players that are capable of playing multiple records.\n\nFLAC\n\nThe Marshall Tucker Band\n\nWhere We All Belong\n\n1974\n\nCD - No artwork\n\n&quot;This Ol' Cowboy&quot; - 6:42\n&quot;Low Down Ways&quot; - 2:57\n&quot;In My Own Way&quot; - 7:17\n&quot;How Can I Slow Down&quot; - 3:19\n&quot;Where a Country Boy Belongs&quot; - 4:32\n&quot;Now She's Gone&quot; (Toy and Tommy Caldwell) - 4:20\n&quot;Try One More Time&quot; - 4:46\n&quot;Ramblin'&quot; - 6:13\n&quot;24 Hours at a Time&quot; - 13:57\n&quot;Everyday (I Have the Blues)&quot; (Peter Chatman) - 11:48\n&quot;Take the Highway&quot; - 7:26\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce08dd28aaabc878dfb4bcdb15a7de4549ad2113","amp;dn":"The+Marshall+Tucker+Band+-+Where+We+All+Belong+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce08dd28aaabc878dfb4bcdb15a7de4549ad2113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,8,221,40,170,171,200,120,223,180,188,219,21,167,222,69,73,173,33,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
