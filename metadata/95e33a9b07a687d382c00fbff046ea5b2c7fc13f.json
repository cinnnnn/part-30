It was released in March of 1970 by Atlantic Records, catalogue SD-7200. It topped the pop album chart for one week and generated three Top 40 singles: &quot;Teach Your Children,&quot; &quot;Our House,&quot; and &quot;Woodstock.&quot; In 2003, the album was placed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nReview:\n&quot;Deja Vu&quot; is a timeless masterpiece of classic rock! It's the crowning achievement of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (CSN&amp;Y), arguably one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Much of their fame and durability over the past 30 years can be traced to this album, which was originally released on vinyl in 1970. It contains some of their most outstanding and famous songs, including the rock anthems &quot;Carry On&quot; and &quot;Woodstock,&quot; David Crosby's tongue-in-cheek &quot;Almost Cut My Hair,&quot; Stephen Stills' forlorn ballad &quot;4 + 20,&quot; and the personal favorite of both my wife and me: &quot;Our House.&quot; Every song shows CSN&amp;Y's tremendous dynamism, versatility and musical maturity. Superbly intelligent lyrics, great guitar riffs (especially Greg Reeves' bass riff in the song &quot;Deja Vu&quot;), beautifully crafted harmonies, and Dallas Taylor's sizzling percussion all converge to make every song on this digitally remastered CD a rock masterpiece.\n&quot;Deja Vu&quot; is one of the landmark albums of all time. It's also one of my personal favorites, and an essential CD, not only for fans of CSN&amp;Y, but for all fans of rock and roll music.\nAmazon Review By Mike Powers\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Folk, Folk-Rock\nQuality: FLAC+.cue\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;Carry On&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26\n2. &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; (Graham Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53\n3. &quot;Almost Cut My Hair&quot; (David Crosby) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n4. &quot;Helpless&quot; (Young) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n5. &quot;Woodstock&quot; (Joni Mitchell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54\n6. &quot;DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu&quot; (Crosby) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n7. &quot;Our House&quot; (Nash) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n8. &quot;4 + 20&quot; (Stills) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:04\n9. &quot;Country Girl&quot; (Young) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:11\n* &quot;Whiskey Boot Hill&quot;\n* &quot;Down, Down, Down&quot;\n* Country Girl (I Think You're Pretty)\n10. &quot;Everybody I Love You&quot; (Stills, Young) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:21\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95e33a9b07a687d382c00fbff046ea5b2c7fc13f","amp;dn":"%281970%29+Crosby%2CStills%2CNash+%26amp%3B+Young+-+Deja+Vu+%5BFLAC%2B.cue+%5D+%7B10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95e33a9b07a687d382c00fbff046ea5b2c7fc13f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,227,58,155,7,166,135,211,130,192,15,191,240,70,234,91,44,127,193,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
