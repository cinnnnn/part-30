With few medical resources, they dedicated their lives to taking care of orphans and the infirmed. She continued her nursing education at the University of Freiburg and began work as an intern for the noted Doctor Brauchle of Dresden. She learned from the master - the restorative \npowers of herbs that had been buried by modern medicine. This served her during the war when medicines became rare - Hanna, as mother and nurse, embodied resourcefulness. \nIn the early '50's, Hanna moved her family to the States and settled in Boulder, Colorado. It was the early days of the herbal renaissance, and she felt like this was an energetic place to start one of the first health-food stores. From her small shop Hanna showed a mastery of the subtle, unique properties of European and American herbs. \nToday, the Kroeger name stands for the highest standards in herbal formulas and homeopathic remedies. Hanna, motivated by her mission to &quot;help each other,&quot; shared her unique spiritual gifts, ageless remedies, and modern therapies with thousands. As Hanna's customers search for alternatives, her volumes of research and her dedicated staff continue to provide valuable resources and products. \n\n/About Hanna Kroeger.pdf\t86.95 KiB\n/Hanna Kroeger - Retreat Center.pdf\t100.88 KiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 01 - Intro &amp; Skeletal Points.avi\t42.77 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 02 - Key Ligaments Points.avi\t13.38 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 03 - Muscle Points.avi\t10.54 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 04 - Ribs out of Place &amp; Low Blood Pressure.avi\t13.44 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 05 - Head Trauma.avi\t12.89 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 06 - General Trauma.avi\t23.04 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 07 - Pneumonia.avi\t9.47 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 08 - Lymph Node Drainage.avi\t8.06 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 09 - Breast Lumps.avi\t34.49 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 10 - Thickening &amp; Thining Blood.avi\t27.89 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 11 - Disolving Blood Clots.avi\t6.87 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 12 - Hiatal Hernia.avi\t65.43 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 13 - Hernia - Lifting Organs.avi\t47.43 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 14 - Revitalizing Spleen.avi\t15.87 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 15 Tonsil Release.avi\t15.13 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 16 - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.avi\t25.02 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 17 - Whiplash.avi\t16.74 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 18 - Balancing Hormones.avi\t27.24 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 19 - Ankles Hips &amp; Knees.avi\t23.94 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 20 - Leukima - Tailbone Adjustment.avi\t91.14 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 21 - Tailbone Additional Comments.avi\t14.61 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 22 - Leukimia - Etheric Brush.avi\t17.17 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 23 - Leukimiea - Juice &amp; Eggs.avi\t15.93 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 24 - Emotion Points - Bodies Master Key.avi\t30.12 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 25 - Anger &amp; Resentment.avi\t6.92 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 26 - Forgiveness.avi\t29.66 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 27 - Syncronizing the Brain.avi\t38.76 MiB\n/Hanna Kroeger's - Hands on Healing - 28 - Wrapup &amp; Prayer Centering.avi\t14.72 MiB\n/READ ME FIRST - Important Info About Hanna Krueger Video.txt\t931 B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0e9f6bb35793b3f6a6141f518abea12f5452065","amp;dn":"Hanna+Kroeger+-+Hands+on+Healing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0e9f6bb35793b3f6a6141f518abea12f5452065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,233,246,187,53,121,59,63,106,97,65,245,24,171,234,18,245,69,32,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
