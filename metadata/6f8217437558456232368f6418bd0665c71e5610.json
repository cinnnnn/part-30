The trauma of the attack turns her away from her parents and her fiancÃƒÂ©e, and, unable to face society, she runs away and, using an assumed name, takes a job on an orange ranch. A young clergyman takes an interest in her, although she won't confide in him. When a ranch hand tries to kiss her, she relives her terrifying experience and nearly kills him. She is arrested but when her identity is established and the facts of her case are brought forth, the clergyman convinces the court that it is society that should shoulder the blame. He helps rebuild her faith and send her back to her parents and fiancÃƒÂ©e.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8217437558456232368f6418bd0665c71e5610","amp;dn":"Outrage+%281950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8217437558456232368f6418bd0665c71e5610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,130,23,67,117,88,69,98,50,54,143,100,24,189,6,101,199,30,86,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
