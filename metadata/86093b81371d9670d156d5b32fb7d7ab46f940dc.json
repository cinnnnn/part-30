ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGone AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ introduces the band in a southern-tinged thunderstorm, sweeping by all blustery and foreboding. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Woman is a WellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is my favorite track, a beautiful tribute to the fairer sex. It wails, lovesick and wanting, and is simultaneously gentle and wrenching. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInterludeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a catchy, quick-paced number with some soulful harmonica playing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummer SongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ brings it down a notch, winding lazily through peaceful images, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMatches and WoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ closes everything out the way it began ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in minor chords and stomp-alongs.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif[/img]\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/08/hello-wheels/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86093b81371d9670d156d5b32fb7d7ab46f940dc","amp;dn":"Hello+Wheels...Baby+John+the+Fox%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86093b81371d9670d156d5b32fb7d7ab46f940dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,9,59,129,55,29,150,112,209,86,213,179,47,183,215,171,70,249,64,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
