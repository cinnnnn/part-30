He met his wife Grace in 1947; fortuitously, she was a capable drummer and harmonica player who played on several of BrimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s records. She was also the vocalist on a 1950 single for the Detroit based Fortune Records, that signaled the beginning of BrimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s discography.\n\nBrim recorded for Random Records, J.O.B. Records, Parrot Records (the socially aware ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTough TimesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and Chess Records (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRattlesnake,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ his answer to Big Mama ThorntonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHound DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was pulled from the shelves by Chess for fear of a plagiarism lawsuit). All of his 1950s recordings for the Chess label were later included on the compilation LP/CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhose Muddy ShoesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which also included the few recordings Elmore James made for the label; because they share this LP/CD, it has sometimes been assumed that they performed or recorded together, but this is not the case.) On some tracks Little Walter played the harmonica, whilst Jimmy Reed, Snooky Pryor, or James Dalton were also featured blowing the harp. Cut in 1953, the suggestive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIce Cream ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ had to wait until 1969 to enjoy a very belated release. BrimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last Chess single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Would Hate to See You Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was waxed in 1956 with a combo consisting of Little Walter, guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr., bassist Willie Dixon, and drummer Fred Below.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
