It has the best-structured screenplay of all his pictures (by Lamberto Antonio, based on the original television script by Mario O'Hara); it's also one of his most atypical, and atypical of even most other Filipino films.\n\nThe film is unique in another sense--Philippine cinema is dominated by the twin themes of love of mother and survival of the family; almost all Filipino films revolve around some aspect of either two. &quot;Insiang&quot; takes these two great, overarching themes and, with an unmatched ruthlessness, dashes them to the ground, shatters them, reveals them to be the fallacies that they really are. The film is saying: &quot;there are no guarantees, not from family, not even from mother; if anything, the most painful betrayals are inflicted by mother and family. You are ultimately alone.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ad17e5215c6966593b29f6ac108aae349a4663c","amp;dn":"Insiang+%281976%29+DVDRip+XViD+Hard+EngSub+%28Pinoy%29+sribats75","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ad17e5215c6966593b29f6ac108aae349a4663c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,209,126,82,21,198,150,101,147,178,159,106,193,8,170,227,73,164,102,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
