The episodes of the first season of the anime were directed by Sunao Katabuchi, animated by Madhouse Studios, and produced by Geneon Entertainment and Shogakukan. In the second season, known as Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage, Shogakukan was not involved in the production.\n\nThe plot of the episodes is based on the Black Lagoon manga by Rei Hiroe, and features the adventures of a Japanese businessman, Rokuro Okajima, after he is abducted by the members of the ship Black Lagoon and joins their crew under the moniker &quot;Rock.&quot; The story follows a team of pirates/mercenaries known as Lagoon Company, who smuggle goods in and around the seas of Southeast Asia in the 1990s. Their base of operations is located in the fictional city of Roanapur in Thailand, and they transport goods in the PT boat Black Lagoon. When on land, they move around and conduct business using Benny&amp;#039;s 1969 Dodge Coronet R/T (with a &amp;#039;69 Plymouth Roadrunner side-scoop induction hood). Lagoon Company does business with various clients, but has a particularly friendly relationship with the Russian crime syndicate Hotel Moscow. The team takes on a variety of missionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which may involve violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and nautical battlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in various Southeast Asian locations and when not doing much, the members of the Lagoon Company spend much of their down time at The Yellow Flag, a bar in Roanapur.\n\nThe first season aired from April 8, 2006 to June 24, 2006 on Chiba TV in Japan. The second season began airing on October 3, 2006 on KBS Kyoto, TV Nagoya, TV Kanagawa, and Sun TV, and concluded its run on December 19, 2006.\n\nThe audio is in the original Japanese, with English subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b161377003a7dac6e45dee277e6a90092d400ad","amp;dn":"Black+Lagoon+-+Both+seasons%2C+Shinsen+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b161377003a7dac6e45dee277e6a90092d400ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,22,19,119,0,58,125,172,110,69,222,226,119,230,169,0,146,212,0,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
