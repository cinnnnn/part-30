Was Bobbie Jo killed by someone she knew or was she killed by a random drifter just passing through? Was her murder related to that of Annette Schnee, the young woman who disappeared on the same night as Bobbie Jo? With little evidence and no suspects, these two top psychics work to provide investigators with new leads and fresh perspectives, in hopes of finally bringing some closure to Bobbie Jo's grieving husband.\n\nSe om det finns nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥got mer jag har lagt upp:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n/carma4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567a442909ae50372deab2c91d08cc75b9034cd7","amp;dn":"Sensing.Murder.S01E02.Mountain.Murders.SWESUB.avi-carma4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567a442909ae50372deab2c91d08cc75b9034cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,122,68,41,9,174,80,55,45,234,178,201,29,8,204,117,185,3,76,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
