She'll graduate high school, travel around Europe, then leave her life in Texas and move to New York. She'll also leave her feelings for the boy she's known her whole life, behind and move on. Or so she hopes.\n\nJackson Cruz is ready for a future as a star quarterback once he graduates high school. It's the path he's been leading for years now. But when his cheerleader girlfriend cheats on him, and a teammate causes a lot of drama, he wonders if this is really the life he's wanted, or if there's something more.\n\nThey thought they had it all figured out-their futures. But life doesn't always go as planned. With feelings revealed, their dreams on the line, this is a year for changes, choices, and a love that might or might not overcome all obstacles.\n\nTold in Jackson and SkylarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s POV, this is a story about acceptance, first love, embracing your passions and finding your way, even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the way you had planned.\nGenre: Contemporary Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5726a1c2bf16515d30423df9975133e492bbfe05","amp;dn":"Torn+by+Annie+Brewer+%28Torn+Heart%2C+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5726a1c2bf16515d30423df9975133e492bbfe05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,38,161,194,191,22,81,93,48,66,61,249,151,81,51,228,146,187,254,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
