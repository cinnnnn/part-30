It was daring but disastrous.\n\nThe 42-year-old ParisianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest returns him to safer and more familiar territory. Like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Under the SandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“5x2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Time to LeaveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ before it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Le RefugeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is an intimate contemporary drama that plays out on bourgeois, metropolitan terrain and concerns itself with examining one or two people and their relationship to love or death. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blessed with a mesmerising performance from Isabelle CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© who was six or seven months pregnant for most of the shoot and appears in nearly every scene. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s short and even slight, more of an observational short story of a film than a rich novel, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s entrancing and moving nonetheless.\n\nWe begin in Paris, but soon, as so often with OzonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s films, find ourselves dragged willingly to the sea. Mousse (CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©) and Louis (Melvil Poupaud) are heroin addicts, and Ozon invites us to share the piercing of their arms and necks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as a director, Ozon worships bodies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ before tragedy strikes and Mousse is left alone and pregnant. An awkward encounter with LouisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haughty mother informs her choice to leave Paris for the coast, where she borrows a house. Soon sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s joined by LouisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother Paul (Louis-Ronan Choisy), himself more of an exile from his background than he seems.\n\nMost of the film chronicles the short period of time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a week, maybe two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that Mousse and Paul spend together in this house. Their interests collide, as when they go to a beach or a club together, and diverge, as when Paul stumbles into a local affair or Mousse encounters strangers with differing attitudes to pregnancy, such as the lecturing woman on the beach or the warm seducer in a bar. Partly, you feel that Ozon just wants to portray a pregnancy up close ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the shots of CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© on the beach or in the bath are fascinating for their uniqueness: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing not to watch an actress with a pillow stuffed up her jumper. But weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re also gently reminded that this is the pregnancy of someone who is an addict, who is without a partner and who is in the throes of grief, even if none of those are always apparent.\n\nAs such, most of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Le RefugeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ unfolds in an ethereal sort of limbo space ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ something of which weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re sharply reminded by a brief, Parisian epilogue that will no doubt have audiences debating its credibility and its rights and wrongs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357880311af2c69194b2405add525f73b5a8e0bd","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+49%29+LE+REFUGE+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357880311af2c69194b2405add525f73b5a8e0bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,120,128,49,26,242,198,145,148,178,64,90,221,82,95,115,181,168,224,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
