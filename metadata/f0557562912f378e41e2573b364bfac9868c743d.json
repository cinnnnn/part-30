Active in five decades of rock music, and frequently re-inventing his music and image, Bowie is widely regarded as an influential innovator, particularly for his work through the 1970s. Bowie has taken cues from a wide range of fine art, philosophy and literature. He is also a film and stage actor, music video director and visual artist.\n\nChangesbowie is a compilation album by David Bowie, released in 1990 in the U.S. by Rykodisc and by EMI in the UK as part of Rykodisc&amp;#039;s Bowie remastering program, to replace ChangesOneBowie. A double vinyl version, released simultaneously, added, in addition, &quot;Starman&quot; (following &quot;Space Oddity&quot;), &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; (following &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;), and &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; (following &quot;Golden Years&quot;). While the cover artwork was generally dismissed as amateurish (&quot;a sixth-form cut &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; paste collage&quot;, according to author David Buckley) the collection made #1 in the UK, giving Bowie his first chart-topping album since Tonight in 1984.\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Space Oddity&quot; (from Space Oddity, 1969) ? 5:16 \n&quot;John, I?m Only Dancing&quot; (from &quot;John, I?m Only Dancing&quot; single, 1972) ? 2:49 \n&quot;Changes&quot; (from Hunky Dory, 1971) ? 3:36 \n&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (from Ziggy Stardust, 1972) ? 3:13 \n&quot;Suffragette City&quot; (from Ziggy Stardust, 1972) ? 3:28 \n&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; (from Aladdin Sane, 1973) ? 4:09 \n&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (from Diamond Dogs, 1974) ? 6:06 \n&quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; (from Diamond Dogs, 1974) ? 4:31 \n&quot;Young Americans&quot; (from Young Americans, 1975) ? 5:13 \n&quot;Fame &amp;#039;90&quot; (Carlos Alomar, Bowie, John Lennon) ? 3:40 \n&quot;Golden Years&quot; (from Station to Station, 1976) ? 4:01 \n&quot;Heroes&quot; (Bowie, Brian Eno) (from &quot;Heroes&quot; single, 1977) ? 3:38 \n&quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (from Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), 1980) ? 4:25 \n&quot;Fashion&quot; (from Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), 1980) ? 4:49 \n&quot;Let&amp;#039;s Dance&quot; (from &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Dance&quot; single, 1983) ? 4:10 \n&quot;China Girl&quot; (Bowie, Iggy Pop) (from &quot;China Girl&quot; single, 1983) ? 4:17 \n&quot;Modern Love&quot; (from &quot;Modern Love&quot; single, 1983) ? 3:59 \n&quot;Blue Jean&quot; (from &quot;Blue Jean&quot; single, 1984) ? 3:10 \n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0557562912f378e41e2573b364bfac9868c743d","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+%28Changesbowie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0557562912f378e41e2573b364bfac9868c743d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,85,117,98,145,47,55,142,65,226,87,59,54,75,250,201,134,140,116,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
