Not a remote, not a thin client; the real deal. No root or jailbreak required. XBMC can be launched as an application on your set-top-box, tablet, phone, or wherever else Android may be found.\n\n If you don't understand just what this is, think of having Wind ows Media Center running on your Android device, fully customizable, open-source, and with full Python plug-in support. Now think of it on Google TV boxes, Android-on-a-stick style devices, or the Nexus Q. Music, video, internet apps like Pandora, all running on Android device. XMBC does all this, and more. Have a look at Wikipedia if you're not familiar with the media center concept.\n\n\nI've uploaded both files rather than start 2 torrents you will have to determine which file is right for you.\n\nTake note Full-neon.APK and NO-Neon.apk at the end of the 2 files\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef60ad52c89baeb1a96ef2d88378c5a7438b48b5","amp;dn":"XBMC+android+update+26.9.12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef60ad52c89baeb1a96ef2d88378c5a7438b48b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,96,173,82,200,155,174,177,169,110,242,216,131,120,197,167,67,139,72,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
