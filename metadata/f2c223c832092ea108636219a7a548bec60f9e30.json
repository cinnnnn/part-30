The movie was a naturalistic depiction of the members of a South London boys' club, which was unusual in showing the leisure life of working-class teenagers as it was, with skiffle music and cigarettes, cricket, drawing and discussion groups. The film represented Britain at the Venice Film Festival. The BBC made two follow-up films about the same people and youth club, broadcast in 1985.\n\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 511 MiB\nDuration                         : 48mn 12s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 481 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 48mn 12s\nBit rate                         : 1 344 Kbps\nWidth                            : 576 pixels\nHeight                           : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.385\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.224\nStream size                      : 463 MiB (91%)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio Layer 3 MP3\nFormat_Settings_Mode             : Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nDuration                         : 48mn 12s\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 44.1 MiB (9%)\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c223c832092ea108636219a7a548bec60f9e30","amp;dn":"We+Are+the+Lambeth+Boys+%28dir.+Karel+Reisz%2C+UK%2C+1959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c223c832092ea108636219a7a548bec60f9e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,194,35,200,50,9,46,161,8,99,98,25,167,165,72,190,198,15,158,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
