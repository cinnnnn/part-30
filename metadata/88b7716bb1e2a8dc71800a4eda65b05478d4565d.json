In the early 1960s, he became a lecturer in Belfast after attending university there and began to publish poetry.\n\nRobert Lowell called him &quot;the most important Irish poet since Yeats&quot; and many others, including the academic John Sutherland, have echoed the sentiment that he was &quot;the greatest poet of our age&quot;. Robert Pinsky has stated that &quot;with his wonderful gift of eye and ear Heaney has the gift of the story-teller&quot;. Upon his death in 2013, The Independent described him as &quot;probably the best-known poet in the world&quot;.\n\n&quot;When a poem rhymes,&quot; Heaney wrote, &quot;when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.&quot;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Beowulf (Translator)\n\n* Collected Poems\n\n* Death of a Naturalist\n\n* Finders Keepers - Selected Prose\n\n* Human Chain\n\n* New and Selected Poems\n\n* North\n\n* Opened Ground\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/heaney-bio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/heaney-bio.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1217/the-art-of-poetry-no-75-seamus-heaney&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1217/the-art-of-poetry-no-75-seamus-heaney&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://brickmag.com/interview-seamus-heaney&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://brickmag.com/interview-seamus-heaney&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_Heaney&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_Heaney&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b7716bb1e2a8dc71800a4eda65b05478d4565d","amp;dn":"Seamus+Heaney+-+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Prose+%288+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b7716bb1e2a8dc71800a4eda65b05478d4565d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,183,113,107,177,226,168,220,113,128,10,78,218,101,176,84,120,212,86,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
