In her eye-opening and effective new book, MBS expert Liz Dean reveals how the key to transforming those dreams into reality lies not in our conscious actions, but in our subconscious thoughts. By aligning the two, we can unleash our own power to lose weight, organise our lives, work more efficiently in our jobs and so much more. Switch Words is this simple yet incredibly powerful tool to help you get there.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle in achieving your goals is your subconscious. Whilst your conscious mind knows what you want and how to get it, experience tells us our subconscious mind can often ignore or sabotage our desires through action or inaction. Have you ever created a meal plan to help you lose weight, but then a couple of days later found yourself inching to the fridge for a snack at 9pm? Even though you were desperate to achieve the body image you wanted, part of you, for some reason, resisted.\r\n\r\nThis is because the words we use when expressing our goals and dreams have unique vibrations which the conscious mind understands â€“ but the subconscious needs a different language in order to respond positively and get with the programme. Through easy-to-follow practices and techniques, Dean guides you to acknowledge the power your sub-conscious can have over everyday actions, how to extract the right switch words to resonate your conscious desire with your subconscious thoughts, and how to use them effectively day to day.\r\n\r\nMethodical and verifiably successful, switch words is the effective way to get what you want, and this book will show you how","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb679f0e403d31eff94ef3bde9e71393b8876aec","amp;dn":"Switchwords+-+How+to+Use+One+Word+%5BePUB%5D+%7B%7BERTB%7D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb679f0e403d31eff94ef3bde9e71393b8876aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,103,159,14,64,61,49,239,249,78,243,189,233,231,19,147,184,135,106,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
