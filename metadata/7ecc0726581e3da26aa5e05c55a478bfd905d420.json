He was the first contemporary artist ever to perform there. The film brings together a compilation of live stage performances interspersed with behind the scenes footage and insights featuring George, his orchestra and the legendary producer Phil Ramone, shortly before his death in 2013.\n In between performances of his classic songs, George describes the stories behind some of his favourite tracks, and we see black and white studio footage of conversations with Ramone, along with rehearsals with the Symphonica orchestra and George's backing singers.\n Before the end, George pays a moving tribute to the late Ramone, whom he describes as the most accomplished producer of the 20th century: 'He understood more about music than anyone I had ever met... And it breaks my heart that he's not around to see this album released or to watch this documentary.'\n Performed tracks:\n Through My Baby Just Cares for Me A Different Corner Cowboys and Angels John &amp; Elvis Are Dead You've Changed Going to Town Brother Can You Spare a Dime Let Her Down Easy You've Been Loved Roxanne Wild is the Wind Praying for Time Feeling Good.\n\n Many thanks to my colleague at TM for capping and sharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ecc0726581e3da26aa5e05c55a478bfd905d420","amp;dn":"George+Michael+At+The+Palais+Garner+Paros+PDTV+x264+TM+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ecc0726581e3da26aa5e05c55a478bfd905d420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,204,7,38,88,30,61,162,106,165,224,92,85,164,120,191,217,5,212,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
