Although difficult to define, Zu's style could be characterised as a fusion of math rock, heavy metal and noise rock, but with the caveat that it does not respect boundaries or genres. The music is instrumental, and features virtuosic drumming, powerful bass and distorted saxophone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79bffcefdd3e04c991c3946922f2b22ea1c451c","amp;dn":"Zu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79bffcefdd3e04c991c3946922f2b22ea1c451c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,155,255,206,253,211,224,76,153,28,57,70,146,47,43,34,234,28,69,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
