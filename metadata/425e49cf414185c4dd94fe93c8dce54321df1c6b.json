But they discover that the island holds many secrets, including a mysterious smoke monster, polar bears, housing with electricity and hot &amp; cold running water, a group of island residents known as &quot;The Others,&quot; and a mysterious man named Jacob. The survivors also find signs of those who came to the island before them, including a 19th century sailing ship called The Black Rock and the ruins of an ancient statue, as well as bunkers belonging to the DHARMA Initiative -- a group of scientific researchers who inhabited the island in the recent past. Lost has won a Golden Globe, 9 Saturn Awards and 8 Emmy awards.

The average for season 2 was 7.0 and for season 1 it was 6.5.  It doesnâ€™t surprise me at all that the average is going up.\r\n\r\nBut Iâ€™d like to show you some fun we can have with the numbers.  Iâ€™m not alone in despising the first 6 episodes of season 3.  Letâ€™s call them season 3 part 1.  That would mean that S3 part 1 got an average of 5.2.  S3 part 2 gets an average of 8.2.  I believe those episodes deserve there respective scores.  I, genuinely, enjoyed all of those later episodes, with the exception of Stranger in a Strange Land.\r\n\r\nAs for other episodes I hated, â€œThe Glass Ballerinaâ€ comes to mind.  That episode bored me to death (not literally).  â€œPar Avionâ€ was pretty weak but was saved by the fact that it was Claireâ€™s last flashback (fingers crossed) and her big reveal was some moderate fun.  â€œI Doâ€ and â€œEvery Man for Himself â€œare bad in their own ways but itâ€™s mostly just the pace.  Those first six episodes had a terrible pace.\r\n\r\nAs for episodes that stood out to me, there were many great episodes.  I loved all of the episodes I gave 10.0s to, obviously.  I recommend that you rewatch those episodes, they were awesome and a half. \r\n\r\nI feel that Lost really stepped up in this season compared the previous seasons.  It moved solidly away from Drama and into Sci-fi with episodes like â€œFlashes Before Your Eyesâ€ and â€œThe Man Behind the Curtainâ€.  The main difference between this season and the others was the addition of Brian K. Vaughn to the writing staff.  I believe he saved the show.  Heâ€™s a modern genius of storytelling and Iâ€™m sure we will hear a lot about him in the coming years.  (If you havenâ€™t already I recommend that you check out his comic series Y: The Last Man.  It is a glorious story.  Itâ€™s currently being made into a movie, but I would love to see it made into a TV showâ€¦on cable.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425e49cf414185c4dd94fe93c8dce54321df1c6b","amp;dn":"Lost+-+Seasons+3+and+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425e49cf414185c4dd94fe93c8dce54321df1c6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,94,73,207,65,65,133,196,221,148,254,147,200,220,229,67,33,223,28,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
