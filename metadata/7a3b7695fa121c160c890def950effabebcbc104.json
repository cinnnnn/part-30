I actually would be happy to get 99 persons to pledge $1 so i can at least get the IOS developer license.\n\nThank you and share with a friend if you can.\n\n\nMain development Site:http://www.indiedb.com/games/flickit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3b7695fa121c160c890def950effabebcbc104","amp;dn":"Flickit+Windows+Physics+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3b7695fa121c160c890def950effabebcbc104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,59,118,149,250,18,28,22,12,137,13,239,149,14,255,171,235,203,193,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
