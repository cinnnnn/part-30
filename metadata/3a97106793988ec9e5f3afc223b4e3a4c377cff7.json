Mutt Lange was impressed by their songwriting abilities and agreed to produce (part of) their debut album. Hence, Romeo&amp;#039;s Daughter was often seen as proteges of Mutt Lange.\n\nThe first album contained the singles &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Break My Heart&quot;, &quot;I Cry Myself to Sleep at Night&quot;, covered by Bonnie Tyler and &quot;Heaven In The Back Seat&quot;, the latter from the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street Part V&quot; soundtrack. The album was produced by Mutt Lange and John Parr. &quot;Wild Child&quot; (written by Mutt Lange) was later covered by Heart on the Brigade album, and &quot;Heaven In The Back Seat&quot; was covered by Eddie Money on his 1991 album Right Here, a track that was also produced by Robert Lange once again.\n\nThe second album, &quot;Delectable&quot; was a more mature affair, although it was released on the smaller Music For Nations label so got less exposure. Mitman went on to work with FM and other bands while the band quietly broke up in the mid 1990s.\n\nOn February 25, 2008, Romeo&amp;#039;s Daughter&amp;#039;s first studio album was reissued by Rock Candy Records on CD with bonus material, a 16-page full colour booklet with original and new artwork, etc.\n\nMembers\nLeigh Matty - Lead vocals and background vocals \nCraig Joiner - Guitars and background vocals \nAnthony Mitman - Keyboards and background vocals \nOn the second album they were joined by:\n\nEd Poole - bass \nAndy Wells - drums and background vocals \n\nDiscography\nRomeo&amp;#039;s Daughter (1988) \nA Nightmare on Elm Street V: The Dream Child Soundtrack (1989) \nDelectable (1993) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a97106793988ec9e5f3afc223b4e3a4c377cff7","amp;dn":"Romeo%5C%27s+Daughter+-+Romeo%5C%27s+Daughter+%5B1988%5D+EAC+Lame+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a97106793988ec9e5f3afc223b4e3a4c377cff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,151,16,103,147,152,142,201,229,243,175,194,35,180,227,164,195,119,207,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
