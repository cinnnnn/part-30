Applications are seen in everything from biological control systems to the tracking controllers of CD players. Some methods, H-infinity design for example, for the analysis and design of control systems are based on sophisticated mathematics while others, such as PID control, are understood and implemented through experimentation and empirical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe BirkhÃ¤user Series Systems &amp; Control: Foundations &amp; Applications examines the abstract and theoretical mathematical aspects of control. Control Engineering complements this effort through a study of the industrial and applied implementation of control â€“ from techniques for analysis and design to hardware implementation, test, and evaluation. While recognizing the harmony between abstract theory and physical application, these publications emphasize real-world results and concerns. Problems and examples use the least amount of abstraction required, remaining committed to issues of consequence, such as cost, tradeoffs, reliability, and power consumption.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Topic Areas\r\n\r\n- General techniques of control system analysis and design\r\n\r\n- Control of manufacturing processes\r\n\r\n- Electrical and electronic controls\r\n\r\n- Modeling and simulation\r\n\r\n- Computer-aided control system analysis and design\r\n\r\n- Process control\r\n\r\n- Digital control\r\n\r\n- Control of transportation systems\r\n\r\n- Mechanical and aeronautical controls\r\n\r\n- Control in mining and metallurgy\r\n\r\n- Instrumentation, hardware, and software for control\r\n\r\n- Robotics and automation\r\n\r\nThe series includes professional expository monographs, advanced textbooks, handbooks, and thematic compilations of applications/case studies.\r\n\r\nSeries Editor\r\n\r\nWilliam S.
