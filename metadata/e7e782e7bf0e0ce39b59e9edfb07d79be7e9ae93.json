The band assumes its place in a dank garage, turns everything up damn loud and lets the booze flow freely.\n\nThe tunes conjure a foggy swamp into close view. Meanwhile, Stu MackenzieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (King Gizzard) production carefully processes the guitar-loaded noise, injecting Spector-esque breathing room. You can sense the five dudes boogieing in unison, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not quite breaking down the walls. That is, except for singer/harmonica wailer Ambrose Kenny-Smith, whose vocal concoction of lived suffering and whisky-guzzling hysteria is the crux of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appeal.\n\nKenny-SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s madman delivery sounds transported from an altogether different era, which makes you wonder what on earth heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing about. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fairly impossible to make sense of the distortion-shrouded yelps, and flicking through the lyric booklet reveals that, other than invoking requisite bluesy tropes (poÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ boy quibbles, railroads, cane fields and suicide), thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not much to report.\n\nNever mind, though, because Loopholes shows that The Murlocs are stocked with plenty of coal to keep this train rollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ forward. Hopefully thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be some curious detours next time around but, for now, jump on board, grab a JD and coke and indulge in the dirty fun.
