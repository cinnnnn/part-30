One of those was the French Class BB 7200, on which the 1600 is based. The 58 locomotives were delivered between 1981 and 1983. As a result of their delivery, the old Class 1000 and Class 1500 were taken out of service.\n\nThanks to the electronic power control, these locomotives were the most economical but also the most powerful locomotives that Dutch Railways had.\n\nThe Class 1700 are similar but not entirely equal to the Class 1600/1800. The newer 1700 series have updated and extended electronics, a newer safety system (ATB phase 4 vs ATB phase 3 in the 1600 series) and a different braking system. The locomotives are fitted with monomotor bogies.\n\nIncludes\n\nThis package contains:\n\nElectric locomotive Class NS 1800.\n\nRealistic sounds.
