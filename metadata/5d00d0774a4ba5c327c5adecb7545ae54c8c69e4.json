Myst captivated the world when it was first conceived and created by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. Its extraordinary success has gone on to spawn Riven, Myst III Exile, and most recently, Uru: The Ages Beyond Myst. Devoted fans of these surreal adventure games gather yearly at &quot;Mysterium&quot; (whose event sites are spreading to other countries) to exchange game strategies, share stories, and meet up with old friends.\n\nThe Myst Reader is a literary companion to the CD-ROM games and a compendium of the bestselling official Myst trilogy: The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni. Devoted fans and new players alike will be delighted to have three books in this mythic saga together for the first time in one value-priced volume, which will be published in time to coincide with the long-awaited release of Myst Revelations.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobyn Miller, best known for his work on Myst, currently lives in Spokane, Washington.
