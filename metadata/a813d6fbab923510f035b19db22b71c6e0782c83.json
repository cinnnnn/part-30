It?s chock full of sideshow characters, all rendered in twisted, loving fashion by Flanagan and digital inker/colorist Tom B. Long. But Johnson?s story delivers more than just creepy characters, too?it?s got genuine heart in places, and will have its share of pathos amongst the freaky characters.\n\nThanks to the original scanners and uploaders.\n\nPlease keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a813d6fbab923510f035b19db22b71c6e0782c83","amp;dn":"Karney+1-4+%28complete%29+%5BBigBonedNinja%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a813d6fbab923510f035b19db22b71c6e0782c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,19,214,251,171,146,53,16,240,53,177,157,178,43,113,198,224,120,44,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
