Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for a vacation. But their hopes for a perfect Paris holiday are dashed when Cat awakes one night in terror. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having visions of a vampire named Gregor, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more powerful than Bones and has ties to her past that even Cat herself didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about.\n\nGregor believes Cat is his and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop until he has her. As the battle begins between the vamp who haunts her nightmares and the one who holds her heart, only Cat can break GregorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hold over her. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need all the power she can summon in order to bring down the baddest bloodsucker sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever faced Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ even if getting that power will result in an early grave","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:474328284f12d22dd31a1e1d594d6952b08a6f9f","amp;dn":"Destined+for+an+Early+Grave+-+Jeaniene+Frost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"474328284f12d22dd31a1e1d594d6952b08a6f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,67,40,40,79,18,210,45,211,26,30,29,89,77,105,82,176,138,111,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
