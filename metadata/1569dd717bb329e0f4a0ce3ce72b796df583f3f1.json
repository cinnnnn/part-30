Back in 2009, Mistiquemusic label bosses Michael &amp; Levan and Stiven Rivic held a competition to remix their track Invisible Children. Then 31 year-old Antti Ervasti was one who answered the call, eventually getting his remix signed. Two months later, Rivic asked the Finn if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be interested in doing an album. The result was 'Solar System', Timewave's debut album. \nThis album contains some superb progressive trance tune along with some trancy breaks that will lift you from earth and send you on the dreamy journy. You will literally experiance the shivers running down your body.\n\nDownload 7 Enjoyy..\nSeed as long as you can...:)  \n\nTracklist\n\n1 Re-Entry\t\t\n2 Outer Rim\t\t\n3 Chance Of Life\t\t\n4 Void (Intro Mix)\t\t\n5 Beyond The Horizon\t\t\n6 Desolate World\t\t\n7 Exodus\t\n8 Searching For The Lost\t\n9 United\t\n10 To Infinity\n\nBit Rate : VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1569dd717bb329e0f4a0ce3ce72b796df583f3f1","amp;dn":"Timewave+-+Solar+System+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1569dd717bb329e0f4a0ce3ce72b796df583f3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,105,221,113,123,179,41,224,244,160,206,60,231,43,121,109,245,131,243,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
