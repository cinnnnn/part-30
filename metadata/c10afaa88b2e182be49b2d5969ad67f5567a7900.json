Bolstered by a Wembley arena-sized single (&quot;Champion&quot;) that dominated television and commercial pop radio in the months before their full-length debut's release, the ten-track Borderland doles out pop hooks like a carnival barker. Glistening, smartly produced, and relentlessly enthusiastic, it's a shame that the songs themselves are all so rote, bloated with lyrical clichÃƒÂ©s and ubiquitous, soaring choruses that are better left in the more capable hands of groups like The Killers or Muse. That said, tracks like &quot;Drive,&quot; &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; and the appropriately epic title cut are as immediate and shiny as they are vacant, and lead vocalist/songwriter Coyle Girelli's Bellamy/Yorke/Bono croon is so unapologetically sincere that it's hard not to get swept up in all of the melodrama, for at least a minute or two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c10afaa88b2e182be49b2d5969ad67f5567a7900","amp;dn":"The+Chevin+-+Borderland+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c10afaa88b2e182be49b2d5969ad67f5567a7900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,10,250,168,139,46,24,43,228,155,45,89,105,173,103,245,86,122,121,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
