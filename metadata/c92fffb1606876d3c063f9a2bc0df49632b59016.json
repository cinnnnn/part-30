Also There are some songs included twice because they are different releases and slightly different quality.)\n\n\nBiography:\n\nIt's simple... we've been together since jan of 2000. As of late, we haven't done much do to our schedules due to our other projects. This will change in the near future. To all who've been following, thanks and sorry for the wait. It will be worth it when it comes to maturity. enjoy a couple of our original DEMO tracks from 2000, new stuff will be posted here some time soon .The new KusH will have Steph and Christian on Guitars,Raymond on drums,B Real on vocals and we have a bassplayer in mind, but we will reveal him in the near future.
