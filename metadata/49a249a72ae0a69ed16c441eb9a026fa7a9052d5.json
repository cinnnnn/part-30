Just compare it to this 1993 release where his voice is very much up front and center. Here from even the first number, &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot;, Gill provides sensitive, heart felt vocal performances. Indeed there is a certain melancholy to the entire outing. It's present in numbers such as &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Till the Season Comes Round Again&quot;, and especially the Gill-penned &quot;It Won't Be the Same This Year&quot;, a tribute to his brother who had passed away shortly before the album's release. Even on &quot;White Christmas&quot;, one of the two tracks where Gill exhibits his formidable guitar skills, the guitar almost seems to sigh. The other guitar instrumental comes in the form of &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot; which is the only upbeat number on the CD and brings Chet Atkins. But even on this track the guitar doesn't so much &quot;rock&quot; as gently &quot;swing&quot;.\nDefinitely a CD for quiet holiday evenings before the fire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a249a72ae0a69ed16c441eb9a026fa7a9052d5","amp;dn":"Vince+Gill+-+Let+There+Be+Peace+On+Earth+-+Country+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a249a72ae0a69ed16c441eb9a026fa7a9052d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,162,73,167,42,224,166,158,209,108,68,30,185,160,38,250,122,144,82,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
