If you like your ninja action straight up - no shiny gold costumes, no magic powers, no chunky white marine ninja wannabes - this one is for you. And no, there's nothing wrong with your vision - Shinobi no Mono was filmed in glorious black and white. This was the very first movie, and probably the last, for that matter, which depicted ninja in a realistic manner. Or at least, as realistic as possible for something so seeped in folklore and fantasy. It came on the heels of dozens of bestselling ninja novels, many of which have been made into films, sometimes several times. Shinobi no Mono is based on one of these novels, written by Maruyama Kazuyoshi.\nShinobi no Mono starts slow, and with the most confusing expository monologue I've ever heard. But after that it finds its groove and ends up being an incredibly enjoyable film. The acting is quite good, with Ichikawa Raizo playing a most sympathetic Goemon, and Ito Yunosuke as the really weird and nasty-looking leader(s) of the ninja clans.\n\n&lt;b&gt;.:: I N F O ::.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;pre&gt;\nName.........: shinobi.no.mono.dvdrip.divx.avi\nFilesize.....: 702 MB (or 718,856 KB or 736,108,544 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:44:19 (150,069 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nVideo Bitrate: 805 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\nFrame Size...: 608x288 (2.11:1) [=19:9]Hardsubbed\nRipper.......: Unknown\n\n&amp;lt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3786ed0b783a5eea8edf6a54c24f26a7b97b4f","amp;dn":"Shinobi.No.Mono.1963.DVDRip.DivX.EngSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3786ed0b783a5eea8edf6a54c24f26a7b97b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,55,134,237,11,120,58,94,234,142,223,106,84,194,79,38,167,185,123,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
