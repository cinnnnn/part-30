You don't even get pro-America at a Democrat convention, usually... The bottom line is they know that you don't get patriotism, you don't get God, you don't get the American founding, you don't get American tradition at a Democrat convention.  Okay, fine.  But when you do get those things at a Republican convention, what happens?  The media rips them to shreds, do they not? \r\n\r\nHillary's Only Chance: Destroy Trump\r\n\r\nNurse Ratched Embraced America's Birth -- and Then Promptly Aborted It\r\n \nhttp://www.rushimg.com/cimages//media/images/hillary-and-nurse-ratched/1522047-1-eng-GB/Hillary-and-Nurse-Ratched.jpg\r\n\r\nRUSH: Here's what Hillary Clinton tried to do last night.  She tried to embrace America's birth, but she couldn't do it.  She then aborted America's birth, explaining how she would butcher and sell off the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Tenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nI Know What's Bothering You\r\nJuly 29, 2016\r\n\r\nRUSH: I know how to boil it down to a precious few words.  You may not even know exactly what it is that's bothering you.  I mean, you may have a specific complaint here or there, but I have the umbrella under which all these things are falling.  I'll tell you exactly what it is. There's no reality.  And this is why people are freaking out.\r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f54270b1c6632e343dbfd5c00fffb76e235988","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+July+29%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f54270b1c6632e343dbfd5c00fffb76e235988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,245,66,112,177,198,99,46,52,61,191,213,192,15,255,183,110,35,89,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
