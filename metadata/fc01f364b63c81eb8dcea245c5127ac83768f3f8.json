The unchecked wrath of Deathlands pits Ryan Cawdor and his companions against long odds. But their skill as survivors, strategists and warriors is unmatched and they've held on to something more precious than life: their humanity. They nurture the hope that somewhere, hidden amid the grotesquerie of a tortured land, safety and sanctuary awaits.\n\nBartering their expertise to a nautical band of brilliant technomads, Ryan's group finds trouble waiting in the steaming, fetid swamplands of the Louisiana Gulf. Merciless storms and pirates strand them in Haven. But the barony's inviting name masks a ville hijacked by fear, territorial conflict and monstrous horror. With the gravely injured Krysty Wroth's fate uncertain, a desperate Ryan aids the strange but hospitable Baron Blackwell in his effort to save Haven from a genetic blood curse. He'll succeed, provided his luckÃ¢â‚¬â€and his optionsÃ¢â‚¬â€don't run out first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc01f364b63c81eb8dcea245c5127ac83768f3f8","amp;dn":"James+Axler-+Haven%27s+Blight+%28Deathlands+102%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc01f364b63c81eb8dcea245c5127ac83768f3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,1,243,100,182,60,129,235,141,206,162,69,197,18,122,200,55,104,243,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
