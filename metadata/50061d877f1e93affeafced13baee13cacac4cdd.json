He released a single ('1917 Revolution') and two albums on Dandelion: &quot;Beau&quot; (1969) and &quot;Creation&quot; (1971) which featured Jim Milne and Steve Clayton from Tractor as backing musicians on some tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50061d877f1e93affeafced13baee13cacac4cdd","amp;dn":"Beau+-+Creation+%281972%2C+2008%29+%28UK+psych+folk%29+%28mp3%2C+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50061d877f1e93affeafced13baee13cacac4cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,6,29,135,127,30,147,175,254,175,206,209,59,174,225,60,172,172,76,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
