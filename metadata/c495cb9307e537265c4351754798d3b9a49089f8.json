He is one of the worlds most renowned artist of erotic comics, and everyone should really be able to recognize his style from just looking at a page, his drawings of women are amazing.\n\nThis version is the new french colour edition, with an amazing new colour scheme, so I of course had to scanlate it, to bring you this gorgeous comic in english.\n\nClick is about a young pretty housewive, Claudia Christiani, who is frigid to the point of being chronically averse to the mere mention of sex. A family friend steals a device, that can turn her sex drive on at will, and star to use this to humiliate her for rejecting him.\n\nThis book contains a lot of sexual acts, but Manara's art is more of a soft core style, so you will not see anything you can't spot watching the average HBO series like Spartacus or True Blood :) But just remember to not hand this book to your kids :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c495cb9307e537265c4351754798d3b9a49089f8","amp;dn":"Click+-+Book+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c495cb9307e537265c4351754798d3b9a49089f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,149,203,147,7,229,55,38,92,67,81,117,71,152,211,185,164,144,137,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
