The term kaseko derives from casser le corps (break the body) which referred to a swift dance during the period when slavery was legal in the region. Kaseko is related to other local styles, such as winti and kawina; like them, it uses call-and-response vocals and complex rhythms. Instruments include drums, saxophone, trumpet and, sometimes, a trombone.\n\nKaseko first evolved out of Bigi Pokoe, which was a 1930s' style played by large brass bands during festivals, strongly influenced by Dixieland jazz. Later, calypso, rock and roll and other styles left an influence.\n\nIn the 1970s, Surinamese expatriates, living in the Netherlands, popularized kaseko. Lieve Hugo (Gentle Hugo in English) is by far the most renowned artist in this genre. All songs on this album were originally recorded in 1974. He sadly died of a heartattack in 1975, ten days before the independance of Suriname. 30 years after his death he is still hugely popular and if you play this CD you will understand why.\nThis CD is remastered in 1990.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
