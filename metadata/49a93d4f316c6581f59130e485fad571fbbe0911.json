Build 20120403 offers you a new feature which automatically verifies vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting and Directory Traversal, and helps you save loads of time.\n\nAcunetix WVS already presents a very low number of false positive results. This build lowers the false positives even more by automatically specifying vulnerabilities that are definite positive results. Each vulnerability that is confirmed as being positive will be followed by a verifying notification. The verification process is therefore easier and much faster. You can focus on fixing discovered vulnerabilities, rather than spending hours checking all the scanned results manually. The scan reports generated by Acunetix WVS 8 are now even more accurate and effective for your web security.\n\nBuild v8.0.20120403 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4th April 2012\nNew Feature:\n\n    Automatic verification of discovered web vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n----------INSTRUCTIONS----------\n\n1.Open the installer for the old build that comes with this programme and install it to the default directory (Look in OLDCRK.rar)\n2.Follow the instructions for the old crack in the rar file names OLDCRK.rar.\n3.Thorugh WVS.exe install the newest build to the default directory.\n4.Copy and paste activation.exe and wvs.exe from this file to the directory where acunetix was installed to and replace the files.\n5.Enter random information into activation.exe and it will succeed.\n6.Open wvs.exe and it is successfully cracked!\n\n----------SOCIAL NETWORKS - FORUMS - WEBSITES-----------\n\nOur website:\nTwitter @SR_shadowrising\nHackforums: Shadow Rising\nPalringo IM: (where you can always find us): [shadow rising]\nE-mail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7e2d161f1a11090c170d1710193e0a1b1d16531d1b100a1b0c501d1113&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a93d4f316c6581f59130e485fad571fbbe0911","amp;dn":"Acunetix+WVS+Crack+Build+20120403+-+April+3%2C+2012+-+Shadow+Risin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a93d4f316c6581f59130e485fad571fbbe0911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,169,61,79,49,108,101,129,245,145,48,228,133,250,213,113,251,190,9,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
