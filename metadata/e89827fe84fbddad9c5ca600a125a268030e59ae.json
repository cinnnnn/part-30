Secession consisted of Peter J. Thomson, Carole L. Branston, Charlie D. Kelly, and J.L. Seenan. Their singer, Peter J. Thomson, who penned their most commercially successful song song &quot;Touch (Part 3)&quot;, died in the late 1990s.\n\nA Dark Enchantment was their only release on CD; this CD is prized by collectors of rare 1980s music. It's interesting to know that the single &quot;Sneakyville&quot; A popular dance club hit, was about the Charles Manson Family murders. Part of the lyrics goes like this:\n\n &quot;Strangers all came to call in the dead of night, on a warm August evening back in 69&quot; &quot;But the screams so it seems noone heard at all, close your eyes when the family come to call&quot; ...... spooky, chilling and awesome! \n\nRipped at 320kbs, this is a re-post as requested.\n\nCatalog#: CD SRN 11  \nFormat: CD, Album\n \nCountry: UK \nReleased: 1987 \nGenre: Electronic  \nStyle: Synth-pop  \nCredits: Engineer - Wilf Smarties \nMixed By - Steve Peck \nProducer - Secession , Wilf Smarties  \n  \nTracklisting:\n\n01   Eventide (2:22) \n02   Promise (4:09) \n03   Love Lies Bleeding (4:35) \n04   Sneakyville (3:44) \n05   Winifred (3:43) \n06   The Box That Holds A Secret (5:23) \n07   Ocean Blue (5:02) \n08   Radioland (4:32) \n09   The Magician (4:22) \n10   Love Lies Bleeding (Reprise) (1:02) \n11   The Wolf (4:18) \n12   Eventide (Theme From A Dark Enchantment) (2:00) \n13   All The Animals Come Out At Night (4:06) \n14   Michael (4:07) \n15   Havoc (3:47) \n16   Promise (Dub) (5:19) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89827fe84fbddad9c5ca600a125a268030e59ae","amp;dn":"Secession+-+A+Dark+Enchantment+%5B1987+Synthpop%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89827fe84fbddad9c5ca600a125a268030e59ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,152,39,254,132,251,221,173,156,92,166,0,161,37,162,104,3,14,89,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
