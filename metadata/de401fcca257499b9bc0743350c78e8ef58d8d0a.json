This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nTHIS BROADCAST ENDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST SONG.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nAs of this countdown, five Beatles covers made the charts that were never released by the Fab Four. This chart makes it six with the highest debuting record of the week..\n\nDue to the popularity of the television show, &quot;Happy Days,&quot; Rock Around The Clock, by Bill Haley &amp; The Comets reappears on the chart after 19 years.\n\nOne singer in the countdown has had more than 80 chart records, and has never hit number one.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown that created maybe the wildest chart coincidence in the rock era. Since 1955, only two songs ever made number one twice (each by different artists), AND both of those songs were written by the same song-writing team!\n\nThere is a hit in the countdown written by the man who also wrote one of the first million sellers of the 21st century, without ever selling a single record.\n\n40: Daylight - Nilsson\n39: Rock Around The Clock - Bill Haley &amp; The Comets\n38: Save The Last Dance For Me - The Difranco Family\n37: My Mistake (Was To Love You) - Diana Ross &amp; Marvin Gaye\n36: One Helluva Waman - Mac Davis\n35: Keep On Singing - Helen Reddy\n34: I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song - Jim Croce\n33: You Won't See Me - Anne Murray\n32: Let's Get Married - Al Green\n31: Oh My My - Ringo Starr\n30: Mighty Mighty - Earth Wind &amp; Fire\n29: Come And Get Your Love - Redbone\n28: Hollywood Swinging - Kool &amp; The Gang\n27: The Payback (Part 1) - James Brown\n26: Hooked On A Feeling - Blue Swede\n25: If You Love Me, Let Me Know - Olivia Newton-John\n24: Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n23: Tubular Bells - Mike Oldfield\n22: Be Thankful For What You Got - William Devaughan\n21: Just Don't Want To Be Lonely - Main Ingrediant\n20: I'm In Love - Aretha Franklin\n19: T.S.O.P. - M.F.S.B.\n18: Bennie &amp; The Jets - Elton John\n17: Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing - Stevie Wonder\n16: My Girl Bill - Jim Stafford\n15: For The Love Of Money - O'Jays\n14: Oh Very Young - Cat Stevens\n13: Billy Don't Be A Hero - Bo Donaldson &amp; The Heywoods\n12: Sundown - Gordon Lightfoot\n11: I Won't Last A Day Without You - The Carpenters\n10: Help Me - Joni Mitchell\n9: I've Been Searching So Long - Chicago\n8: The Locomotion - Grand Funk\n7: Midnight At The Oasis - Maria Muldaur\n6: You Make Me Feel Brand New - Stylistics\n5: Band On The Run - Paul Mccartney &amp; Wings\n4: The Show Must Go On - Three Dog Night\n3: The Entertainer - Marvin Hamlisch\n2: Dancing Machine - Jackson Five\n1: The Streak - Ray Stevens\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de401fcca257499b9bc0743350c78e8ef58d8d0a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1974_May_25th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de401fcca257499b9bc0743350c78e8ef58d8d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,64,31,204,162,87,73,155,155,192,116,51,80,199,142,142,245,141,141,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
