ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a smell of honey in the air. Unfortunately she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a supreme master in flapping her wings and so the mountains ahead seem to be a big problem. \n\nLuckily the world is full of beautiful hills which force the pace. To build up speed you have to slide along the hills. Then let the tiny bee soar. \n\nMake sure to have a soft landing and collect as much honey or pollen as possible - you have to complete tasks in every level. \nThere are several achievements to reach. Share your scores via OpenFeint and climb your way to the top of the leader boards.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nPatchday: Tablets and more!\n- 16mb heap devices fixed (milestone, magic)\n- Tegra2 Tablets running on Honeycomb working fine now. (Xoom, Transformer etc.)\n- Archos 10.1 bit more performance\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nurogames.android.tinybee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nurogames.android.tinybee&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:023e7c855b0f01874b07f58fb2affc258998f43b","amp;dn":"Tiny+Bee+v1.28.06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"023e7c855b0f01874b07f58fb2affc258998f43b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,62,124,133,91,15,1,135,75,7,245,143,178,175,252,37,137,152,244,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
