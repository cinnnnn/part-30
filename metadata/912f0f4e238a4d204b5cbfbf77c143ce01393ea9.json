The story was adapted for the West End stage as Billy Elliot the Musical in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on Broadway in 2008.\nWhen the film was released in the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America gave it an R rating due to language. When released on video, it was re-cut to a PG-13 rating for &quot;some thematic elements&quot;; this version edited out many uses of profanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:912f0f4e238a4d204b5cbfbf77c143ce01393ea9","amp;dn":"Billy+Elliot.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"912f0f4e238a4d204b5cbfbf77c143ce01393ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,47,15,78,35,138,77,32,75,92,191,191,119,193,67,206,1,57,62,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
