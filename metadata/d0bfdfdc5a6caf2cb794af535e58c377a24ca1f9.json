Not surprisingly, the only ones who seem to like it (apart from the castÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mothers) are very religious Christians. To them, no respectful dramatization of biblical themes is ever called to task for being bad theater. You have the holy trinity of such fare here: Biblical, Bland, and Boring. You could also add an apocryphal alliteration of being broadly badly written, badly directed, and badly acted. Begorrah!\n\nThe rights to the series have been purchased by an umbrella Christian organization, and they have done a cheap job of encoding it for release on DVD. This means it could not be neatly ripped into episodes, that the sound sync is a hair off, and that there are no subtitles. They have also included a PDF study Guide on how your church group can use the film to teach. So, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to see a historically shaky film on how Christianity became the dominant religion of Ancient Rome, here ya go.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.D._%28film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.D._%28film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088471/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088471/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nVideo Bitrate........: 918kbps \nDuration.............: 1:27:33\nResolution...........: 512*384 \nFramerate............: 29.970 \nAudio Codec..........: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbps CBR \nAudio Channels.......: 2\n\n\nA.D.
