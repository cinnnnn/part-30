This package also includes Wineskin Winery, with a few older version of the Wrapper and Engine.\n\nUnpacked, it is 13GB.  I broke it down into 100mb segments using 7z compression.  You'll need a 7z utility to unpack and un-segment.\n\nI've stripped all the *.ini files of information, so you'll have to provide your own set of 3 CD keys, Gamespy user name, etc.\n\nAlso, there are no PW files, so you'll have to download those as well.  I guess that goes without saying, but....\n\nFurthermore, after stripping the package of all extraneous and incriminating information, I haven't actually tested if it works.  \n\nGood luck!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37be885200fc2ab5868893924f9f4869ba38d23e","amp;dn":"NWN2+Wineskin+emulation%2C+Wrapper+2.5.5+and+Engine+1.5.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37be885200fc2ab5868893924f9f4869ba38d23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,190,136,82,0,252,42,181,134,136,147,146,79,159,72,105,186,56,210,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
