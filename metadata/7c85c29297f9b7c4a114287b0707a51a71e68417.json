But with two Grammy nominations, a Gold Record, two of the top rated one-hour specials in Comedy Central history, a book that appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List, and CD and DVD sales of over 10 Million units, Ron has established himself as a star in his own right.\n\nThis collection contains all three to date Ron White solo video concerts.\n\n&quot;They Call Me Tater Salad&quot; earned Comedy Central the highest rated Sunday in its history. The companion DVD has sold 1.4 Million copies to date and has been certified &quot;Multi-Platinum.&quot;\n\n&quot;You Can't Fix Stupid&quot; was filmed in January 2006 at the Majestic Theater in Dallas, TX. The special aired on Comedy Central to 4.5 Million viewers to make it the third largest audience in Comedy Central's history and the 1 show in prime time on basic cable.\n\n&quot;Behavioral Problems&quot; covers a variety of taboo topics, from his wife's plastic surgery (he carries her silicone implants around in his &quot;man purse&quot;), a recent incident with Florida police regarding his plane and 7/8ths of a gram of marijuana, and a 14-foot grizzly bear. And we sat down to enjoy this DVD where he riffs for over an hour, we laughed so hard at one point that we could hardly breathe. It's a good thing DVD players have a &quot;pause&quot; button or we would have missed the next 15 minutes of his show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c85c29297f9b7c4a114287b0707a51a71e68417","amp;dn":"Ron+White+Collection+%28They+Call+Me+Tater+Salad%2C+You+Can%5C%27t+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c85c29297f9b7c4a114287b0707a51a71e68417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,133,194,146,151,249,183,196,161,20,40,123,7,7,165,26,113,230,132,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
