Hildur possessing no skills or any practical experience tries to find work but without success. She's about to give up when by pure coincidence she lands a job selling role playing books and accessories at the local fantasy-shop Astropia. From that moment her life transforms. At Astropia Hildur is introduced to a group of nerds who give her a new outlook on life. Among them are Dagur a translator of romantic fiction, Scat a rapper who makes his nerdlyness look cool, the comic and video clerks Floki and Pesi, the violent tomboy Beta and an eight year old whizkid Snorri. Gradually unlikely friendships are formed and Hildur enters the fantasy world of role playing where she struts around in a skimpy outfit slaying Orcs and Goblins and the world of adventure starts blending into her real life. Her old boyfriend Jolli, determined to get Hildur and his old lifestyle back, breaks out of jail and kidnaps Hildur. Hildur's ragtag group of friends are not about to let her go without a fight. In the end it really is up to Hildur and her newfound self-confidence and independence to break free from Jolli's shackles once and for all.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.0/10 (456 votes)\n\nSource.........: DVD\nLength.........: 94 Mins\nResolution.....: 560x368\nAspect Ratio...: 1.78:1\nVideo Bitrate..: 882 kb/s\nVideo Framerate: 25.00 fps\nAudio Bitrate..: 146 kb/s MP3 Stereo\nAudio Language.: Icelandic\nSubtitles......: English (HARDCODE)\n\ncredit VH-PROD &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1404577b33e30fa4d5a9add19a6da962704108b","amp;dn":"Astropia.2007.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1404577b33e30fa4d5a9add19a6da962704108b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,64,69,119,179,62,48,250,77,90,154,221,25,166,218,150,39,4,16,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
