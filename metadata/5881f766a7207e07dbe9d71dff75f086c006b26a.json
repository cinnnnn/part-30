The maps show all the planets and stars visible to the naked eye, as well as some galaxies and nebulas, the Ecliptic, meteor showers and the Milky Way. Constellations are drawn in their traditional form, and a table lists the visible objects. MacAstronomica also features an Orrery that simulates the solar system, a sundial/moon dial, an astrological birth chart generator complete with an overview, and a lot more. The interface is very elegant and easy to use. And finally, MacAstronomica lets you print customized sky maps and birth charts.\n   download and seed if you like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5881f766a7207e07dbe9d71dff75f086c006b26a","amp;dn":"macAstronomica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5881f766a7207e07dbe9d71dff75f086c006b26a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,129,247,102,167,32,126,7,219,233,215,29,255,117,240,134,192,6,178,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
