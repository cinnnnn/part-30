When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her resumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all the fun out of the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d350e679896c37279efe259f1bf68810b1d0f6c3","amp;dn":"The+simpsons+s22e3+LOL.+%7EINVICTA+RG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d350e679896c37279efe259f1bf68810b1d0f6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,80,230,121,137,108,55,39,158,254,37,159,27,246,136,16,177,208,246,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
