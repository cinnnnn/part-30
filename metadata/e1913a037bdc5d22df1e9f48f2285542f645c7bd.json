Popular tracks like &quot;Am I Not Human&quot;, &quot;Our Last Hope&quot; and &quot;Titan Dream&quot; will give you an idea of where &quot;Speed Of Sound&quot; is heading. There are some very strong melodies on this album and a cohesive theme that is very interesting and very Sci-Fi. Vocals on the album come from Aya Peard and Nick Phoenix. Percussion played by Greg Ellis, Satnam Ramgotra, Nick Phoenix, Toss Panos, Curt Bisquera and Peter Franken. Orchestra is Capellen Orchestra.\n\nView my profile for the 320 kbps mp3 version.
