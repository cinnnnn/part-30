As a result, the record is stronger and more varied than its predecessor, which helps put their ska workouts in sharper relief. They still have a bit of trouble putting together a consistent set of material, but on the whole, Hang-Ups is evidence that the band is starting to mature and improve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:581b6cf9b6c8c4884534d6858348444ba99b4281","amp;dn":"Goldfinger+-+Hang-Ups+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"581b6cf9b6c8c4884534d6858348444ba99b4281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,27,108,249,182,200,196,136,69,52,214,133,131,72,68,75,169,155,66,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
