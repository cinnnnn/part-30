In Building a Bridge to the Eighteenth Century he revisits the Enlightenment, that great flowering of ideas that provided a humane direction for the future -- ideas that formed our nation and that we would do well to embrace anew.\n\nHe turns our attention to Goethe, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Kant, Edward Gibbon, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and Franklin, and to their then-radical thinking about inductive science, religious and political freedom, popular education, rational commerce, the nation-state, progress, and happiness.\n\nPostman calls for a future connected to traditions that provide sane authority and meaningful purpose -- as opposed to an overreliance on technology and an increasing disregard for the lessons of history. And he argues passionately for specific new guidelines in the education of our children, with renewed emphasis on developing the intellect as successfully as we are developing a computer-driven world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40fb3b01745b7cc2ffacb70befd58b26f5a714bd","amp;dn":"Building+a+Bridge+to+the+18th+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40fb3b01745b7cc2ffacb70befd58b26f5a714bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,251,59,1,116,91,124,194,255,172,183,11,239,213,139,38,245,167,20,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
