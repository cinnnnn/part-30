Their sound is influenced by bands like At the Gates, In Flames, Morbid Angel, Dissection, and Carcass. Their music makes use of the death metal sound, containing elements such as blast beats and fast death metal style riffs. Vocalist Trevor Strnad alternates between both deep, throaty &quot;death metal growls&quot; and a more high-pitched black metal and hardcore scream [3]. The band&amp;#039;s most popular songs include &quot;Funeral Thirst&quot;, &quot;Miasma,&quot; and &quot;A Vulgar Picture&quot;. They played in Ozzfest 2005 and also participated in the Sounds of the Underground tour in 2006, which encompasses both the US and Canada. They are also scheduled to play at Wacken Open Air in 2007.\n\nCurrent bassist Bart Wiliams left his former band, Detroit&amp;#039;s &quot;Today I Wait&quot; to tour with the Black Dahlia Murder. After touring with the band on their co-headlining run with Throwdown and their European dates with Liar, he joined the group full-time. Bart was one of two engineers (the other being Walls of Jericho&amp;#039;s Mike Hasty) on the band&amp;#039;s first full length, &amp;#039;Unhallowed&amp;#039;.\n\nTheir most recent album Miasma peaked at 118 on The Billboard 200. Recently, Pierre Langlois left the band for a more secure lifestyle, and the band has finished their search for a replacement drummer and found former All That Remains drummer, Shannon Lucas.\n\nWhile originally the band had a website at www.blackdahliamurder.org, Sometime between late 2006 and early 2007 it dissapeared. There are no indications left whether the site will be brought back or not, but for the time being, they can be found on their Myspace page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8f8ba367edf67a3777e201ba247199d2713b3f","amp;dn":"The+Black+Dahlia+Murder+DiscographyHXAXUXNXTXEXD.RAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8f8ba367edf67a3777e201ba247199d2713b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,143,139,163,103,237,246,122,55,119,226,1,186,36,113,153,210,113,59,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
