Mandell\n\n\n\nChelsea House Pub, 2007\nPDF-144 pages\n\n\nBetween 1675 and 1676, King Philip's War shattered native tribes and devastated the new English colonies in one of the most significant American wars of the 17th century. The conflict that triggered this terrible war developed more than 50 years, as Indians found their lands shrinking and their resources threatened by the colonists. The powerful Pequot and Narragansett tribes were subjugated, and Wampanoag leader King Philip (Metacom) saw his lands taken and his counselors executed. In July 1675, his warriors started an uprising that gained the support of other tribes and sent refugees streaming into Boston. King Philip's War is a penetrating account of this decisive confrontation, which ultimately led to the end of native independence in the area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36aa8db458518b3d0fd2ccb90150663728d21f11","amp;dn":"King+Philip%27s+War%3A+The+Conflict+Over+New+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36aa8db458518b3d0fd2ccb90150663728d21f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,170,141,180,88,81,139,61,15,210,204,185,1,80,102,55,40,210,31,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
