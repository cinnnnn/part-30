Michael Straczynski and published from 2000 to 2002 by Top Cow Productions.\n\nLos Angeles police officer Lieutenant David Grey encounters a brutal murder. When he tracks down a possible lead he encounters strange, goblin-like men who attack him. When he awakes, Grey finds himself in a hospital, and those around him have become translucent and can no longer see him. It is explained to him by his mysterious guide Laurel that he has lost his soul and he has now been plunged into a shadow world that runs parallel to our own. David is informed by Laurel that &quot;The Other Guy&quot; holds his soul and he must travel on foot to New York to claim it.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8fa3b1621204a4b2733074e7b2b974993dd0ef0","amp;dn":"Midnight+Nation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8fa3b1621204a4b2733074e7b2b974993dd0ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,250,59,22,33,32,74,75,39,51,7,78,123,43,151,73,147,221,14,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
