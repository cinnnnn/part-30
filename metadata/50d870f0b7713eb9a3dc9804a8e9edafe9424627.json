They illustrate the wallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toll on lives and livelihoods, showing the hardship it has brought to tens of thousands of people, preventing their access to work, education, and vital medical care.\nMixed with the images are portraits and vignettes, offering a heartfelt and inspiring account of a people determined to uphold their dignity in the face of profound injustice.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d870f0b7713eb9a3dc9804a8e9edafe9424627","amp;dn":"Against+the+Wall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d870f0b7713eb9a3dc9804a8e9edafe9424627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,216,112,240,183,113,62,185,163,220,152,4,168,233,237,175,233,66,70,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
