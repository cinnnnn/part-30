'Pissed And Driven' represents what many would describe\nas another honest, barebones, no frills rock album. 'The recipe is the same\nas the first. I didn't deviate from what I believe BLACK WATER RISING music\nto be, I didn't set out to grow or mature', says frontman Rob Traynor. He\ncontinues, 'I feel this new album is not much of a departure from the first,\nand I believe that's a good thing. Besides, I don't think fans would want it\nany other way. I'm still writing from the same place I was writing from\nbefore, I'm still the same guy...for better or for worse.'\nInvigorated and eager to capitalize on the success of their debut album, the\nband's new material promises to be riff heavy and proudly anchored in the\nfoundations of traditional hard rock and metal song writing with hooks and\ncatchy choruses to pull you in. New songs like 'Show No Mercy', 'Pissed And\nDriven', 'Last Man Standing' and 'Fire It Up' combine the band's love of\nThin Lizzy and Judas Priest with the sonic stomp of Black Label Society, all\nwhile retaining a musical identity of their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fedecc9b4e1ec5fa58f89c9408bf12e5f9c40f01","amp;dn":"Black_Water_Rising-Pissed_And_Driven-2013-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fedecc9b4e1ec5fa58f89c9408bf12e5f9c40f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,222,204,155,78,30,197,250,88,248,156,148,8,191,18,229,249,196,15,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
