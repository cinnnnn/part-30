This was followed by the storylines &quot;Aftershock&quot; and then &quot;Road to No Man's Land&quot; which resulted in the U.S. government officially evacuating Gotham and then abandoning and isolating those who chose to remain in the city. &quot;No ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Land&quot; covered, in detail, a period in the lives of the residents of the city, explaining all events from the time of isolation, until its time of re-opening and the beginning of rebuilding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c031644f16217b8e41cf6064d2a42cfa2204b29","amp;dn":"31.No+Man%5C%27s+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c031644f16217b8e41cf6064d2a42cfa2204b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,3,22,68,241,98,23,184,228,28,246,6,77,42,66,207,162,32,75,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
