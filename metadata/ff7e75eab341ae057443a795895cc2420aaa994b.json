Wood, the American Revolution is the most important event in our history, bar none. Since American identity is so fluid, we have had to continually return to our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding to understand who we are. In a series of illuminating essays, he explores the ideological origins of the RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬â€from Ancient Rome to the European EnlightenmentÃ¢â‚¬â€and the foundersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attempts to forge a democracy. He reflects on the origins of American exceptionalism, the radicalism and failed hopes of the founding generation, and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“terrifying gapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between us and the men who created the democratic state we take for granted. This is a profoundly revealing look at the event that forged the United States and its enduring power to define us. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n&quot;Mr. Wood is our premier student of the Founding Era. He has been writing history for about a half-century, roughly a fifth of the days since the origin of the republic. He has scrupulously avoided appropriating his subject for modern-day political purposes and instead tried to understand it on its own terms and as a whole. Historians will of course bring to their study certain questions and concerns of their own timeÃ¢â‚¬â€no one can or should avoid thisÃ¢â‚¬â€but the greatest historians are those, like Mr. Wood, who do not make our criteria of importance the main theme. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦It is Mr. Wood's most Ã¢â‚¬ËœpersonalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work, providing us, along with much fine history, glimpses into the thinker and the man.&quot;\n\nKirkus Reviews\nA Pulitzer and Bancroft PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning historian offers deeply contemplative essays from a career devoted to studying the Revolutionary Era.\n\nIf, as Wood (History/Brown Univ.; Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815, 2009, etc.) asserts, the Revolution &quot;is the most important event in American history, bar none,&quot; it follows that arguments over its ideology, the doctrinal core of the nation's creation, become critical, not just to contemporary politicians and activists looking to the past for legitimacy, but evenÃ¢â‚¬â€and more regrettablyÃ¢â‚¬â€to generations of historians bent on imposing their own era's preoccupations. The author discloses his own methodology, of particular value to those interested in historiography, and also important to the general reader looking for reliable information about the nation's origins. Wood rejects the temptation to take sides among history's combatants. Rather, the historian's task, he writes, is to examine why they &quot;thought and behaved as they did,&quot; understanding that ideas, while important, are subordinate to passions driving social change, that they are always constrained by the facts on the ground and frequently entail consequences that no one, not even their sponsors, could foresee. With these stipulations and with genuine modestyÃ¢â‚¬â€in postscripts to most of these essays, Wood frequently offers second thoughts about pieces composed years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€he covers such topics as the disconnect between the sometimes lurid rhetoric accompanying the more prosaic reality of the Revolution; the Founders' fascination with the rise and fall of Republican Rome; the unique radicalism shared by Jefferson and Tom Paine; the conspiratorial interpretation of events that flourished in the 18th century; the era's sincere fear of monarchism on the one hand, mob rule on the other; the ideal of disinterestedness versus the competing interests unleashed by messy democracy; the peculiar awkwardness of the republic's first decade; and the origins of our unique constitutionalism and our sometimes misguided political evangelism. It's difficult to conjure another writer so at home in the period, so prepared to translate its brilliant strangeness for a modern audience.\n\nSound, agenda-free analysis, gracefully presented.\n\nMeet the Author\nGordon S.
