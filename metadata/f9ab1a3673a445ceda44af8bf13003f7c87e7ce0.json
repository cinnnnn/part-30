On this album, arguably the best in his career, Hancock demonstrates what he was learning while working in Miles Davis' group, and even expands on those ideas. Freddie Hubbard, at the top of his game, sits in for Miles, and the remainder of Miles' group sound looser as a result. But this is Hancock's show and he contributes four of the five tunes, including two jazz standards- the beautiful &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; and the atmospheric title track. Equally impresive is the quiet tension displayed on &quot;Eye of the Hurricane.&quot; Sit back and enjoy the cruise.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
