But the arduous adventures were finally rewarded when, in front of the camera, a Count RaggiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bird of Paradise enthralled him with its frenzied dance.\nIn this audio release, David tells of his adventures during the trip: being an onlooker at a formal lovemaking ceremony, seeing the skills of ritual axe making, trying to master pidgin English and witnessing a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“sing singÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ at which hundreds of tribesmen came together from all parts of the country.\nSpecially recorded for audio, the magical voice of the master broadcaster entertains and educates in this fascinating account of life in the wilds of the South Pacific.\nDavid Attenborough, BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice of natural history, narrates his often perilous early adventures in New Guinea.\n\n\nSource...........................3 CDs\nNumber of MP3s.........3\nTotal Runtime...............2 Hours 55 Mins\nAbout &quot;Quest Under Capricorn&quot;\nAs part of his continuing adventures filmed for the BBC TV series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Zoo QuestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, David Attenborough ventured to the Northern Territory of Australia. It is an area that extends for a thousand miles from north to south and nearly six hundred miles from east to west.\nDripping, waterlogged jungle covers the north of the Territory, while a ferociously arid desert lies in the south. For a three-man film crew hoping to capture the essence of the Territory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ its people, its landscape and its animals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the environment was truly daunting.\nSpecially recorded for audio, this third volume from AttenboroughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chronicles of his early expeditions finds him meeting Aborigines, going walkabout in the bush, learning the secret craft of the artists of Arnhem Land, and seeking out a trio of canny no-hopers of debatable origin.\nIn unique Attenborough style, 'Quest Under Capricorn' paints a compelling and fascinating picture of life Down Under.\nDavid Attenborough, BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice of natural history, narrates his first expedition to the other side of the world.\n\nAbout The Author and Reader\nIt may be difficult to imagine a time when David Attenborough was not a household name, yet his career as a maker of natural history documentaries evolved through a mixture of talent, fate and luck.\n\nBorn in London in May 1926, Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School, Leicester and Clare College, Cambridge. He did National Service in the Royal Navy and worked in educational publishing before joining the BBC.\n\nAt the age of 28, he had been a BBC producer for two years working on a variety of programmes from ballet to party political broadcasts, none of which satisfied his desire to put his zoology degree to good use. He and Jack Lester, London ZooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Curator of Reptiles, persuaded their respective employers to mount a joint animal-collecting expedition that would result in a filmed series for the BBC and a collection of rare animals for the zoo.\n\nAt the time the BBC cameramen had no experience of such a project, but for the price of a pint of beer they enticed Charles Lagus, recently returned from an expedition in the Himalayas, to join them and they set off for Sierra Leone.\nThe idea was to combine live film of the animals together with footage of how they were caught. Attenborough moved in front of the cameras for the first time when the ZooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expert fell ill.\n\nThat was in 1954. The Zoo Quest series was so popular that similar expeditions were launched to different parts of the tropics annually for the next ten years. In Zoo Quest for a Dragon, Attenborough related his adventures in parts of Indonesia which were then little known, looking for animals which had never been filmed before, including the now-famous dragons that live on the tiny and remote island of Komodo.\n\nOther Zoo Quest programmes took him to Guyana, Argentina, Paraguay, the south-west Pacific, Madagascar, northern Australia and down the Zambezi from source to mouth.\nIn 1965 David Attenborough became Controller of the fledgling BBC2 television network. However, after eight years of sitting behind a desk he returned to programme-making during which time he made his mark by writing and narrating several highly acclaimed series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Life on Earth, The Living Planet, The Trials of Life and, more recently, The Private Life of Plants, The Life of Birds, The Blue Planet, The Life of Mammals and Life in the Undergrowth. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e7a3ba0a02a30b0688bc4e16d7f340e7c845b8","amp;dn":"David+Attenborough+-+The+Early+Years+Collection++%28Box+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e7a3ba0a02a30b0688bc4e16d7f340e7c845b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,231,163,186,10,2,163,11,6,136,188,78,22,215,243,64,231,200,69,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
