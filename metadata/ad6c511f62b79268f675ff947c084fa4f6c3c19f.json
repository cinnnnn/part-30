In this world youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re surrounded by sexual images that open the door to temptation. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€œon TV, billboards, magazines, music, the internetÃ¢â‚¬â€œand so easy to access that it sometimes feels impossible to escape their clutches. Yet God expects his children to be sexually pure. So how can you survive the relentless battle against temptation? HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful ammunition.\n\nSteve Arterburn and Fred Stoeker, the authors of the hard-hitting best-seller Every ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Battle, now focus on the temptations young single Christian men like you face every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€œand they offer workable, biblical strategies for achieving sexual purity.\n\nThe authors examine the standard of Ephesians 5:3Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬Å“there must not be even a hint of sexual immoralityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œin a positive and sensitive light. And they explain how an authentic, vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ is the key to victory over temptation. Every Young ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Battle will show you how to train your eyes and your mind, how to clean up your thought life, and how to develop a realistic battle plan for remaining pure in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexually soaked culture. As a result, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll experience hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€œreal hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€œfor living a strong, pure life GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way.\n\nThe video also features a portion of the interview from Dr. James Dobson conducted with serial killer Ted Bundy.\n\n\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6c511f62b79268f675ff947c084fa4f6c3c19f","amp;dn":"POtHS+3+-+Bible+-+112+-+Every+Young+Mans+Battle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6c511f62b79268f675ff947c084fa4f6c3c19f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,108,81,31,98,183,146,104,246,117,255,148,124,8,79,164,246,195,193,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
