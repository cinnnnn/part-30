The work\nwas never published in her lifetime and was only brought to light in the early 1950's when it was unearthed in the\nBodleian Library, Oxford.\n\nIn our own times the novella doesn't seem nearly so shocking - but her father's attempted suppression is perhaps understandable:\nunlike Frankenstein, written a year earlier, Mathilda uses fantasy to study a far more personal reality. As she lies on her\ndeathbed, the narrator tells her story. [ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦]\n\nYet, despite characters clearly based on herself, her father, and her husband, the narrator lifts the story beyond\nautobiographical resonance into something more transcendent: a passionate tale of a brave woman's search for love, atonement,\nand redemption.\n\nFrom her deathbed in an isolated country cottage, Mathilda, a young gentlewoman with a tragic past, sets out to tell her\nclosest friend and the wider public the secret behind her long depression and self imposed seclusion.....\n\nAbridged by Eileen Horne\nRead by Emilia Fox\n\nProduced by Clive Brill\nA Pacificus Production for BBC Radio 4.\n\nBroadcast 21 - 25 Mar 2011 @ 22:45 on BBC Radio 4\nSome blurb withheld for spoilers.\n\n* Episode 1[/b]\n1/5.
