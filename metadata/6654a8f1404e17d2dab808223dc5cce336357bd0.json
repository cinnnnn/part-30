He embraced the market and the amazing transportation and communications revolutions beginning to take hold. He helped give birth to the modern industrial economy.\n\nAbraham LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of an upwardly mobile society that rewards and supports individual striving was wondrously realized. Now, it is under threat. To meet these challenges, conservative columnist Rich Lowry draws us back to the lessons of Lincoln. It is imperative, he argues, to preserve a fluid economy that makes it possible for individuals to thrive and live the American dream.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://94b3a76e023813757a0f-ae89554633acf7b3ce455bd027c59041.r69.cf5.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pic_giant_060513_lincoln-unbound.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://94b3a76e023813757a0f-ae89554633acf7b3ce455bd027c59041.r69.cf5.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pic_giant_060513_lincoln-unbound.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://c0.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_relatred_060513_lincoln-unbound.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://c0.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_relatred_060513_lincoln-unbound.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n About the Author :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/44/49/b4/4449b47551b3d2ca8a1b38b6c7fc7cc8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/44/49/b4/4449b47551b3d2ca8a1b38b6c7fc7cc8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRich Lowry was named editor of National Review in 1997.
