Old &amp; in the Way were one of the greatest progressive bluegrass bands of the early '70s, and each subsequent release proves that they were a special band. Even if you are intimately familiar with its two predecessors, it's unlikely you'll be disappointed with Breakdown.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fbe983db7f0a80c7c2d3acb68974acf7f7c05f6","amp;dn":"Old+%26amp%3B+In+The+Way+-+Breakdown+%7B1973+%281997%29%7D+HDCD+to+24b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fbe983db7f0a80c7c2d3acb68974acf7f7c05f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,190,152,61,183,240,168,12,124,45,58,203,104,151,74,207,127,124,5,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
