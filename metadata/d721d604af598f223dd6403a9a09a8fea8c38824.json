Alexandra Grimal\nplays the sax, and how, with all her heart and body, stunningly,\nsensitively. Antonin Rayon plays the organ, creating some weird aural\nlandscape, uninhabitable at times, often inhospitable, rarely sweet, while\nEmmanuel Scarpa does the drumming, breaking all possible patterns while keeping\nthe drive going (how does he do that?). Especially on the long first track\n&quot;Mouvances&quot;, this leads to some great listening experience. Something totally\nnew, yet also attractive, powerful and sensitive at the same time. The second\npiece, the one-minute long &quot;En Silence&quot;, captures the essence of the music:\ndark, somewhat industrial, yet fragile at the same time. This vision is further\nexpanded upon in the long &quot;Le Sang N'Est Pas Bleu&quot; (the blood is not blue), a\nslow and equally depressing piece, on which Grimal's high soprano is the only\nlight in the darkness, yet then she switches to tenor, and her wailing becomes\ndeeper, more desperate. At times it's hard to categorize this music as\njazz. The sounds produced by Rayon and Scarpa are more based on rock tradition,\ncreating an atmosphere that is in essence alien to jazz, but one in which\nGrimal's playing fits perfectly. And as the lead voice, she is the one defining\nthe music, its evolution, its sound, its otherworldliness, its agonizing\nterror, its intense expressivity, its vulnerability. What a voice for a debut\nalbum : strong, full of character and what a powerful musical vision! Highly\nrecommended.\n\n--\n\npar Jean Buzelin (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.culturejazz.fr/spip.php?article1117&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.culturejazz.fr/spip.php?article1117&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d721d604af598f223dd6403a9a09a8fea8c38824","amp;dn":"Alexandra+Grimal+Trio+-+Shape.+Live+at+the+Sunset+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d721d604af598f223dd6403a9a09a8fea8c38824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,33,214,4,175,89,143,34,61,214,64,58,154,9,168,254,168,195,136,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
