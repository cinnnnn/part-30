Guide to Reclaiming the Value You CreateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn Life Inc, award-winning writer Douglas Rushkoff traces how corporations went from being convenient legal fictions to being the dominant fact of contemporary life. The resulting ideology, corporatism, has infiltrated all aspects of civics, commerce, and cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€from the founding of the first chartered monopoly to the branding of the self, from the invention of central currency to the privatization of banking, from the Victorian Great Exhibition to the solipsism ofLife Inc explains why we see our homes as investments rather than places to live, our 401(k) plans as the ultimate measure of success, and the Internet as just another place to do business. Most important, Rushkoff illuminates both how weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve become disconnected from our world and how we can reconnect to our towns, to the value we can create, and, mostly, to one another. As the speculative economy collapses under its own weight, Life Inc shows us how to build a real and human-scaled society to take its place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdebee3485b50db5edfede40d6054213cf691378","amp;dn":"Life+Inc%3A+How+Corporatism+Conquered+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdebee3485b50db5edfede40d6054213cf691378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,235,238,52,133,181,13,181,237,254,222,64,214,5,66,19,207,105,19,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
