A roots music form of sorts, the sound of the genre reflects the combined influences of European and Middle Eastern music. Rebetiko music has sometimes been called the Greek blues, since like the blues, it grew out of a specific urban subculture and reflected the harsh realities of an oppressed subculture's lifestyle: poverty, alienation, crime, drink, drugs prostitution, and violence. But rebetiko's subject matter also extends to other subjects: romance and passion, social matters, people such as the mother, death, the difficulties of living in a foreign country, army life, war, trivial matters of everyday life, exotic places, poverty, labor, illnesses, and the minor sorrows of people. A major theme of Rebetiko is the pleasure of using drugs, especially hashish. Rebetiko songs of this kind are called ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â§ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã†â€™ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â»ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¯ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â´ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â± (hasiklidika). Also like the blues, rebetiko progressed from being a music associated with the lower classes to becoming during the 1960s and later a revived musical form of wide popularity, especially among younger people. Rebetiko music was closely associated with the mangas Greek urban subculture. Finally, rebetiko songs usually display the same chord progressions found in songs from classic Mississippi delta bluesmen like Robert Johnson and others &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebetiko&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebetiko&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to tera7, asterastrip and looksee for helping me out on the transcription issue :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256e779be6494946285af763e56439abdb3612f8","amp;dn":"Rebetiko+Sergiani+-+Songs+of+Istanbul+%281920+-+1940%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256e779be6494946285af763e56439abdb3612f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,110,119,155,230,73,73,70,40,90,247,99,229,100,57,171,219,54,18,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
