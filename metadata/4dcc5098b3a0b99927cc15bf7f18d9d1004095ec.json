Some very complex works emerged form this period, such as Solage's &quot;Tres gentil,&quot; but also quite a few high-spirited, directly stated ones. These are interspersed throughout this album.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nNotes, texts and translations are enclosed.
