In September 1997, a visually impaired woman named Patty was raped by an intruder in her home in Madison, Wisconsin. The rookie detective assigned to her case came to doubt PattyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account and focused the investigation on her. Under pressure, he got her to recant, then had her charged with falsely reporting a crime. The charges were eventually dropped, but Patty continued to demand justice, filing complaints and a federal lawsuit against the police. All were rebuffed. But later, as the result of her perseverance, a startling discovery was made. Even then, PattyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ordeal was far from over.\n     Other books have dealt with how police and prosecutors bend and break the law in their zeal to prevail. This one focuses instead on how the gravest injustice can be committed with the best of intentions, and how one womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bravery and persistence finally triumphed.\n \n\n \nCourage Award Winner, Wisconsin Coalition against Sexual Assault\n\nPrint Length: 290 pages\nPage Numbers Source ISBN: 029921964X\nPublisher: University of Wisconsin Press; 1 edition (August 29, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B002AJ893O\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cry-Rape-Harrowing-Justice-ebook/dp/B002AJ893O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372553860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Cry+Rape%3A+The+True+Story+of+One+Woman%27s+Harrowing+Quest+for+Justice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cry-Rape-Harrowing-Justice-ebook/dp/B002AJ893O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372553860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Cry+Rape%3A+The+True+Story+of+One+Woman%27s+Harrowing+Quest+for+Justice&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2ab560709b9b0dee9a6a3895ec277ea17c98d6","amp;dn":"Cry+Rape%3A+The+True+Story+of+One+Woman%27s+Harrowing+Quest+for+Just","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2ab560709b9b0dee9a6a3895ec277ea17c98d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,42,181,96,112,155,155,13,238,154,106,56,149,236,39,126,161,124,152,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
