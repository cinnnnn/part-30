Aside from one of the two\ncycles of viral production (high school biology,\nanyone?), Andrew Sannie, Anthony Sannie, Mungala\nLonde and Gavin Kalansky are The Lytics. The group\nhas been playing its brand of smooth hip-hop from\nthe south end of the city since 2003. The LyticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nbeats are effortless in their flow and rhythmic in\ntheir execution, a showcase of how hip-hop should\nsound. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refreshing is that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sing\nabout stereotypical hip-hop themes like money,\nbitches and hos. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to say they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sing\nabout girls or parties, but they craft rhymes about\nlove without being abrasive, sexist and\nunnecessarily profane, which allows them to appeal\nto a broad audience. The Lytics are a rare gem in\nthe city and some may be surprised that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re\neven from Winnipeg. They produce high-calibre\nhip-hop that even a 20-year-old white suburbanite\nfrom St. James who listens to Fall Out Boy can\nenjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13f909e6ae93673ec322ef9fdcb4424f41d8740e","amp;dn":"The_Lytics-The_Lytics-2009-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13f909e6ae93673ec322ef9fdcb4424f41d8740e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,249,9,230,174,147,103,62,195,34,239,159,220,180,66,79,65,216,116,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
