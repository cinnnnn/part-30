This is not a rip. It is the official release spreading. \n\nLinux has never been better or easier. If you have never tried linux - it is time!\n\nThis version is for almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors.\n\nThe desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of CD is what most people will want to use. You will need at least 320MB of RAM to install from this CD.\n\nFor more info.
