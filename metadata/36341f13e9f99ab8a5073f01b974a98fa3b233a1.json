Pushed to his limits by a horrific accident, Liam discovers he has an amazing ability: he can 'move' to parallel universes where things always turn out just the way he wants. But every time he moves the fabric of the metaverse begins to tear. And something evil begins to find its way in ... A gripping fantasy adventure story of the battle between a teenage boy and a terrible demon. It is also the deeper tale of how Liam changes, emerging from the final crisis a much wiser person than the boy for whom the ability to swap universes made the world his toy. A thrilling roller-coaster ride from an award-winning author.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36341f13e9f99ab8a5073f01b974a98fa3b233a1","amp;dn":"Move+by+Conor+Kostick+%28retail+EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+AZW3%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36341f13e9f99ab8a5073f01b974a98fa3b233a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,52,31,19,233,249,154,184,165,7,63,1,185,116,169,143,163,178,51,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
