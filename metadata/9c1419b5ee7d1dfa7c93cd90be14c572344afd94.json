Coyote (also known simply as &quot;The Coyote&quot;) and the Road Runner are cartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Brothers. The characters went on to star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts and occasional made-for-television cartoon. The E never refers to a name within the context of the cartoon, but a 1975 comic has it standing for &amp;#039;Ethelbert&amp;#039;. Although his last name is routinely pronounced with a long &quot;e&quot; as in the real-life animal (e.g. &quot;ky-O&amp;#039;-tee&quot;), in at least one case, he has been heard pronouncing it with a long &quot;a&quot; (e.g. &quot;ky-O&amp;#039;-tay&quot;, To Hare is Human) in an attempt to sound refined or intelligent.\n\nThe Coyote has separately appeared as an occasional antagonist in Bugs Bunny shorts. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings. The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, &quot;beep beep&quot;, and an occasional tongue noise. Wile E. was initially voiced by Mel Blanc[1] and the Road Runner by Paul Julian.[2]\n\nPACK 4\n\nTorrent multitraker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1419b5ee7d1dfa7c93cd90be14c572344afd94","amp;dn":"%5Bwww.misateam.net%5D-%5BSatrip-Mpeg1-Eng%5D+Willie+il+coyote+%28ep.+34-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1419b5ee7d1dfa7c93cd90be14c572344afd94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,20,25,181,238,125,29,250,124,147,205,144,190,20,197,114,52,74,253,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
