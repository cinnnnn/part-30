It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be pretty. It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\nbe dull. And surely, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be safe. In fact, making\njust one wrong choice could put evil at your bedside\nwatching you sleep.\n\nAnd so it is with Kate Simmons, a young woman who, by\nchoosing to regain her life, actually puts it at risk by\nthe very choices she makes. After unimaginable heartbreak\nstops her world on a dime, Kate falls into a three-year\nblackness of self blame that brings her to the edge of\nlife, itself. As time finally brings light back through\ntiny cracks of renewed desire, Kate moves out of the\nprison she made for herself in her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home to find a\nnew reality, rooming with her best girlfriend, Charlie.\n\nYet, to be free is to be vulnerable, and KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choices\nmore than ever mark a splattered line between being happy\nand being dead. Care to choose? HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your menu:\nA strangely alluring building manager so possessed with\nwanting you for his own, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bury more than the fact he\nhas a girlfriend; a buff college student for whom you are\nclearly hot, as are all the other girls on campus; a pushy\nlawyer who is as handsome as he is intoxicated with\nconquest, who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take no for an answer, who gets what\nhe wants Ã¢â‚¬â€ always.\n\nSometimes, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whom you choose. Sometimes, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who chooses\nyou. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Kate, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both, and it puts you on a perilous\nroad where good looks and humor are the thin masks of jealous\ndelusion and utter violence. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in trouble when the sum\ntotal of your choices is written in blood red.\n\n\nFallen for You (The Killer Next Door #1)\nby Carlie Sexto\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 375","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b642f351a6fd14062c3d4764b9c8e4878fee9e1","amp;dn":"Fallen+for+You+%28The+Killer+Next+Door+%231%29+by+Carlie+Sexton+EPUB+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b642f351a6fd14062c3d4764b9c8e4878fee9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,100,47,53,26,111,209,64,98,195,212,118,75,156,142,72,120,254,233,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
