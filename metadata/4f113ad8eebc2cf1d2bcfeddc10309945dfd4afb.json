Black Emperor, titled F#A#Infinity. I know that the vinyl version of this album is already available on Demonoid in the form of 192 Kb/s MP3 files, but I wanted to experiment in making a more complete package akin to some of the things that I see posted. Additionally, everything that I have available is lossless. My aim is for this to be as organic of a release as possible.\n\nThe vinyl edition differs from the compact disc edition in several ways. I personally prefer the CD to the LP in this instance, since the remastered edition actually sounds better (this isn&amp;#039;t a comment on analog vs. digital; their original version just doesn&amp;#039;t sound as good) and because some of the new recordings of the movements are musically superior. The album ends a bit abruptly because of the infinite playing time that the LP has due to the locked groove (hence the infinity in the album name).\n\nThe following breakdown comes from the Wikipedia article on the album:\n\nSide one\n\n   1. &quot;Nervous, Sad, Poor...&quot; - 20:43\n         1. &quot;The Dead Flag Blues (Intro)&quot; - 6:09\n         2. &quot;Slow Moving Trains&quot; -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:23\n         3. &quot;The Cowboy&quot; -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:16\n         4. &quot;Drugs in Tokyo&quot; - 3:29\n         5. &quot;The Dead Flag Blues (Outro)&quot; - 1:52\n         6. (untitled segment) - 1:34\n\nSide two\n\n   1. &quot;Bleak, Uncertain, Beautiful...&quot; - 17:40\n         1. &quot;...Nothing&amp;#039;s Alrite in Our Life...&quot;/&quot;The Dead Flag Blues (Reprise)&quot; - 2:00\n         2. &quot;The Sad Mafioso&quot; - 5:33\n         3. &quot;Kicking Horse on Brokenhill&quot; - 5:36\n         4. &quot;String Loop Manufactured During Downpour...&quot; - 4:29\n\nI constructed a CUE sheet (though it&amp;#039;s probably not &quot;correct&quot; to an enthusiast, as I&amp;#039;ve never created one nor used one, personally) to adhere to the movements, but I provide the music in two FLAC files. Long tracks should be nothing new to somebody who already listens to GY!BE, but if you want to split up the tracks into movements to burn this to a CD, use the CUE sheet. I&amp;#039;m providing the FLAC Fingerprint File, too.\n\nOnce again, because of many factors, this version will not sound as good as the CD version! My pre-amplifier isn&amp;#039;t the greatest; the original analog edition of this album is not mastered extremely well; the LP, though I brushed it, contains unavoidable artifacts; quiet parts of any record, no matter how clean, reveals a noticeable tracking hiss; the list goes on &amp; on. I cleaned the stylus before and after recording each side for the best result. I can at least say that the sound levels never broke 0 db while being recorded, so no clipping occured.\n\nI really wanted people to hear this version of the album in addition to experimenting with a project like this (I&amp;#039;ve integrated ideas from both the studio album sharing community and live concert recording sharing community). It took me all day to do these things! Please download, copy, and share with fellow fans of the band. DO NOT disrespect the band by selling copies! Please consider purchasing the album if you like it enough.\n\nOne last thing for this diatribe: the FLAC files are tagged with the proper unicode characters, I think, but some players (ahem, Winamp) don&amp;#039;t support the encoding. Make changes as you need!\n\n-Pedantic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f113ad8eebc2cf1d2bcfeddc10309945dfd4afb","amp;dn":"Godspeed+You%21+Black+Emperor+-+F%C3%A2%E2%84%A2%C2%AFA%C3%A2%E2%84%A2%C2%AF%C3%A2%CB%86%C5%BE+%28vinyl+rip%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f113ad8eebc2cf1d2bcfeddc10309945dfd4afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,17,58,216,238,188,44,241,210,188,254,221,193,3,9,148,93,253,74,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
