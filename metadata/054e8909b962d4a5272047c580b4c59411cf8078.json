The Chicago native also delved into professional songwriting, penning tunes for Kenny Rogers and the St. Elmo's Fire soundtrack before landing a solo contract with EMI Records. Featuring production from David Cole, who later launched C+C Music Factory, Marx's self-titled debut was released in 1987 and catapulted the artist to the top of the Billboard charts. &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot; and &quot;Should've Known Better&quot; were slick, radio-ready singles that emphasized guitar riffs and power chords, but Marx's real strength lay with ballads like &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; and &quot;Hold on to the Nights.&quot; By the time Repeat Offender arrived in 1989, Marx had already established his presence on the charts; nevertheless, the album helped make him a genuine star, with &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; marking his third consecutive number one hit in America. Another song, &quot;Angelia,&quot; was Marx's record-breaking seventh consecutive single to crack the Top Five.\n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n\n01.Whatever We Started\n02.Suddenly\n03.Inside\n04.Beautiful Goodbye\n05.Forgot To Remember\n06.Turn Off The Night\n07.Have A Little Faith\n08.Like The World Is Ending\n09.To My Senses\n10.Getaway\n11.Eyes On Me\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054e8909b962d4a5272047c580b4c59411cf8078","amp;dn":"Richard+Marx+-+Beautiful+Goodbye+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054e8909b962d4a5272047c580b4c59411cf8078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,78,137,9,185,98,212,165,39,32,71,197,128,180,197,148,17,207,128,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
