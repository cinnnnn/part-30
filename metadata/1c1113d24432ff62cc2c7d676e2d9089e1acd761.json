He studied music at the Cathedral of ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°vora with Filipe de MagalhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£es. On January 1597 he was already mestre de capela of the Cathedral of Badajoz (Spain), where he stayed until 1613. In that year, he went to the cathedral of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡laga and succeeded Francisco VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡squez bearing the same office as CristÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³bal de Morales, precisely 50 years before. He stayed in MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡laga until his death in 1641.\nChurch Music: The church music of de Brito represents a particularly late flowering of the Renaissance, tempered by Baroque innovations. His setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, from the Holy Week liturgy, is characteristic of his style.\n\n \n1. Parce Mihi, Domine\n2. Responde Mihi\n3. Spiritus Meus Attenuabitur\n4.
