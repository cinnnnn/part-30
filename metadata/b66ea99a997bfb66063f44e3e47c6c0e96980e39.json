An A side, a B side and tracks no longer than 6 minutes in length. Because of this, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect format to allow us the freedom to quickly surprise you with new music any day of the week by any current or future artists. They send us the music, we quickly get it to you.\n\nFor this premiere fortyFive, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a little something by blocSonicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founder and creator Mike Gregoire aka mGee. Later this year heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serving as a guinea pig to test out a new hybrid release model with a two part album release, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tourist Trap, Parts 1 &amp; 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (more details to come later this year). Until then, he plans on releasing the occasional fortyFive for you to enjoy.\n\nOn this one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a brand new track called Ã¢â‚¬Å“StandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which samples the great Josh Woodward song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let It InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a remastered and updated version of the first track he released via mgee.blocsonic.com back in 2010, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kick It Along The Transit Line (fortyFive Version)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the fortyFive series and all the goodies that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure to bring. RememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ blog itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ podcast it! If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in radioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ support independent music and broadcast it!\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection: Netlabels\n\nArtist/Composer: Michael Gregoire\nDate: 2012-03-09\nKeywords: blocsonic; fortyFive; mGee; old orchard beach; maine; mp3; flac; ogg\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b66ea99a997bfb66063f44e3e47c6c0e96980e39","amp;dn":"mGee+-+Stand+%28March+9%2C+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b66ea99a997bfb66063f44e3e47c6c0e96980e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,110,169,154,153,123,251,102,6,63,68,227,228,124,108,14,150,152,14,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
