The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps. To the Finzi-Continis, though, it doesn't really matter. They're different from the other Jews because wealth and privilege have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable. They hardly seem to know, or even care, about the fact that their rights are slowly being taken away. It seems that years of prestige and social status have put them above the laws of the land.\n\nThe walled garden of the Finzi-Continis is a symbol for the false security that people retain, unaware that problems on the outside may force them into reality. The garden of the film seems to promise that nothing will change and that everything will remain the same. Interestingly, de Sica films the garden in a way that enforces this theme of false security. He never orients us visually with the rest of the city, so we can never tell how big or how small the garden is. Have you ever felt uneasy being somewhere not knowing the exact dimensions of your boundary? That's the feeling we get here with shots of the garden that seem to stretch on forever.\n\nThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis is a great film for many reasons, one of which is how it forces us to take a proactive stance regarding the world that we live in. There's nothing wrong with feeling secure but it's important to try to take an objective stance with reference to the world that we live in. And you certainly don't want to be on the outside looking in to those who have realized it already.\n\n------not my rip--- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3338/0007170js.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3338/0007170js.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/875/0009464ge.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/875/0009464ge.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/2503/0027400wr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/2503/0027400wr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3276/0028093hn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/3276/0028093hn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~ Il Giardino dei Finzi-Contini.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................939,663,360                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.0.0              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:34:31                \nFrame Count:....................................135960             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................336                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.905                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1124                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.218&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................188                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
