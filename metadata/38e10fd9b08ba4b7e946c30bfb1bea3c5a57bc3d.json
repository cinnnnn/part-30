In Recording Reality, Desiring the Real, Elizabeth Cowie looks at the history of documentary and its contemporary forms, showing how it has been simultaneously understood as factual, as story, as art, and as political, addressing the seeming paradox between the pleasures of spectacle in the documentary and its project of informing and educating.\n Cowie claims that, as a radical film form, documentary has been a way for filmmakers to acknowledge historical and contemporary realities by presenting images of these realities. If documentary is the desire to know reality through its images and sounds, she asks, what kind of speaking (and speaking about) emerges in documentary, and how are we engaged by it? In considering this and other questions, Cowie examines a range of noteworthy films, including Spike LeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s When the Levees Broke, John HustonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Let There Be Light, and Milica TomicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Portrait of My Mother.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e10fd9b08ba4b7e946c30bfb1bea3c5a57bc3d","amp;dn":"Recording+Reality%2C+Desiring+the+Real+%28Visible+Evidence%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e10fd9b08ba4b7e946c30bfb1bea3c5a57bc3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,225,15,217,176,139,164,183,233,70,195,11,251,27,234,60,90,87,188,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
