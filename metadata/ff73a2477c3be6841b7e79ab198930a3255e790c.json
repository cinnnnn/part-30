I know it's on various lists, but I've never seen a copy. Ever. Anywhere. And I own literally every gold CD Mobile Fidelity (in its original form, before the closure in 1999) ever released, including the rare samplers and various test and sound check discs. \n\nIf anyone is interested in some of the samplers and/or test/sound check discs, let me know. I seem to remember one of the jazz samplers being a part of the initial group, but there were actually two different jazz samplers (JS-1 and JS-1A). Alan Parsons helped them create a sound check disc, which I don't think was a part of any group so far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff73a2477c3be6841b7e79ab198930a3255e790c","amp;dn":"MFSL+UDCD+24kt+Gold+Fill+Pack%3A+702%2C+704%2C+713%2C+741%2C+746%2C+750%2C+752","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff73a2477c3be6841b7e79ab198930a3255e790c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,115,162,71,124,59,230,132,27,126,121,171,25,137,48,163,37,94,121,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
