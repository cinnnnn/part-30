Penguin edition. MOBI format (Kindle).\n\n\nCapital, Marx's major and most influential work, was the product of thirty years close study of the capitalist mode of production in England, the most advanced industrial society of his day. This new translation of Volume One, the only volume to be completed and edited by Marx himself, avoids some of the mistakes that have marred earlier versions and seeks to do justice to the literary qualities of the work. The introduction is by Ernest Mandel, author of Late Capitalism, one of the only comprehensive attempts to develop the theoretical legacy of Capital.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee0d23178686313542e5f6a59000323fc9da8fd","amp;dn":"Capital%2C+A+Critique+of+Political+Economy+-+Karl+Marx.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee0d23178686313542e5f6a59000323fc9da8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,224,210,49,120,104,99,19,84,46,95,106,89,0,3,35,252,157,168,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
