When it first passes the bedroom there is nobody there but each time it shows the room again Chantal Akerman is sitting on the bed, motionless first, then busy doing something (peeling an orange, eating an orange, etc.). When she is last seen she yawns and lies down on her bed. The camera continues panning but after 10 minutes and 21 seconds the film comes to an end and she can't be seen asleep.\n\n\nNo languages or subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c728e4d7400ebf9ef15806519158d0c2723825a","amp;dn":"La+Chambre+1972+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c728e4d7400ebf9ef15806519158d0c2723825a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,114,142,77,116,0,235,249,239,21,128,101,25,21,141,12,39,35,130,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
