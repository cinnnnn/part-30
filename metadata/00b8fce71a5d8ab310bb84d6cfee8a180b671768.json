Von HerzenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harmonica swings from dark and melodic, to a full steam rollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ freight train thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll knock you on your ass and keep on going. Social D album credits include ~ Coulda Been Me, Drug Train &amp; Ghost town Blues. http://www.ericvonherzen.com/\n\nKyle Jester on vocals &amp; guitar, formerly with Candye Kane &amp; Earl Thomas: I formerly played with Candye Kane, Earl Thomas, Freddie Brooks, &amp; Thomas Yearsley of the Paladins Ã¢â‚¬â€ and I have been running my own band since 1999. My usual outfit is a 4-piece (guitar, bass, &amp; drums with either piano or harmonica), but I also put together intimate acoustic duos and large 6- or 8-piece bands. It has always been by goal to provide a traditional, but high-energy electric blues show. http://kylejester.com/\n\nHarding joined Social Distortion in November 2004 and replaced temporary bass player, Matt Freeman, who is best known for working as the bass player of Rancid. His first recording with the band was re-recordings of their older material and &quot;Far Behind&quot;, which appear on their 2007 Greatest Hits album. He also appeared on the band's seventh studio album Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, which was released in January 2011.[1][2][3] This would be the band's first proper studio album with Harding. Prior to joining Social Distortion, Harding was the bass player for Mike Ness during his Cheating at Solitaire tour and recorded with Ness on his second solo offering Under the Influences. His previous bands include Deke Dickerson And The Ecco-Fonics, The Eugene Edwards Band, The Lucky Stars, The Sleepwalkers and The What-Me Worry? Jug Band. He also plays stand up bass for an insurgent bluegrass band called [http://www.whiskeychimpband.com Whiskey Chimp in his home town of Ventura, CA. He appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien while playing bass with Mike Ness Band. Summer of 2007 saw the birth of Harding's newest project, The Steeplejacks. Along with Harding, the band consists of Jonny Wickersham (Social Distortion, U.S. Bombs and Youth Brigade) on guitar, Sam Bolle (Fear, Dick Dale, Agent Orange) on stand up bass, Toby Emery (Raging Arb and the Redheads, Jackass) on mandolin and guitar and Bill Flores (The Rincon Ramblers, Louie Ortega) on pedal steel, fiddle and accordion. Harding plays guitar and drums with the Steeplejacks. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Harding\n\nTom Essa Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slim CrowbarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on drums, formerly with Mississippi Mudsharks: The front man has the map, but the drummer does the drivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tow truck drivinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, on the road of American Roots RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. HittinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the skins professionally for over 20 years, driving to thousands of performances over a million miles of road. LayinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ it down and groovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the American Roots influenced styles of Blues, Swing, Rockabilly and good olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rock &amp; Roll with The Mississippi Mudsharks, The Kyle Jester Blues Show, Big daddy and the Money Shakers, Billy Wtason, Hot Rod Lincoln and many more. Aside from years of stage and studio experiance, he also studied quite a bit, holding three degrees in music with stints in university concert band, symphonic band, big band and percussion ensemble. Fusing education and experiance into a unique drum style that delivers everything from a little tippy tap, to a fierce and blistering attackÃ¢â‚¬Â¦sometimes intense, sometimes comical. When he practices he think with his head, when he writes he thinks with his heart, when he performs he donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think at all!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b8fce71a5d8ab310bb84d6cfee8a180b671768","amp;dn":"Atomic+Road+Kings+-+Unreleased+CD+-+high+energy+harmonica+blues+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b8fce71a5d8ab310bb84d6cfee8a180b671768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,184,252,231,26,93,138,179,16,187,132,214,207,238,138,24,11,103,23,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
