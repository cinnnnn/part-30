Originally signed by Aware Records after their showcase at the 1995 South By Southwest festival, their self-titled debut, though rather low budget, received some airplay. Eventually signing with Capitol Records, Stir produced a more focused, radio-friendly follow-up with 2000's Holy Dogs. \n\n\nThe sophomore effort from St. Louis' Stir, while being the product of obviously talented musicians, fails to show much distinction from the majority of the late-1990s' alterna-pop bands. Though you can occasionally hear flashes of U2 or Big Star in their brand of power pop, the overall radio-friendly nature of songs makes them seem rather formulated. Still, it's altogether possible they have a landmark album in them somewhere. \n\n\n\nGenres: Alternative, Music, Pop, Rock, American Trad Rock, Adult Alternative\n\nHoly Dogs - Released: Mar 14, 2000\n\n    \n1  Superstation\t\t\t3:43  \n2  Climbing the Walls\t\t3:49  \n3  Velvet Elvis\t\t\t5:35  \n4  New Beginning\t\t\t3:57 \n5  Only a Dream\t\t\t4:08  \n6  Spaceman\t\t\t5:43  \n7  Stop Killing Me\t\t\t3:59 \n8  Help\t\t\t\t3:53 \n9  Grounded\t\t\t4:06 \n10 Moon\t\t\t\t3:49 \n11 Clear\t\t\t\t4:04\n12 Holy Dogs\t\t\t3:08\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21d67d1940a5b7057bb208ffb72f3a79f8cc36f9","amp;dn":"Stir+-+Holy+Dogs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21d67d1940a5b7057bb208ffb72f3a79f8cc36f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,214,125,25,64,165,183,5,123,178,8,255,183,47,58,121,248,204,54,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
