Automatically people relate certain artists with each other. So if you say Beatles, you probably think Stones as well. So I made rows of five (easy for my display and overview) more or less related artists that all changed the world on their own (similar) way. \n\nHowever, this sound picture does not show a &quot;complete&quot; image without including some misfits with a real impact on the musical soul of the world. Like Mike Oldfield for instance or Johnny Guitar (and why not Jimi Hendrix? Try to make a playlist and you know).\n\nSo I looked for five misfits to complete the picture. Probably you don't expect ABBA here but to honest, ABBA is a must for any collection and is in fact really unique....
