To improve his social life and waistline, he joins a supper club for dieters who lovingly call themselves the &quot;Flab Five.&quot; Avoiding carbs is nearly impossible in this deep-fried potato-loving land, so a mysterious death in their small burg provides an effective, if disturbing, distraction.
