Originally a balck metal band, they've changed their style considerably to a more grating death doom with classical influences. \nAnd it is beautiful indeed. The album begins with the ambient instrumental that is lush with classical influences such as violin and cello before launching into the doom drenched chords of &quot;Pray.\n&quot; \nThe music is a bit faster than most doom metal, hence some traces of black metal with the blastbeats, but the keyboard laced in the background is clear as day with the deep, grunting vocals full on steam with the usual crushing melodies mixed with clear production.\n \n&quot;SIlence Embraced&quot; makes more use of the synth as a background ambience instrument and the solos are pretty decent, except at one point one feels a bit like it went out of tune.\n\nTenebra\nEnoch\n\nType:\n    Full-length\nRelease date:\n    September 24th, 2010\nCatalog ID:\n    N/A\n\nLabel:\n    Independent\nFormat:\n   mp3\n    \n1. \tEntering the Path \t01:13 \t \n2. \tPray \t04:35 \t \n3. \tSilence Embraced \t07:54 \t \n4. \tThe Poem of Emptiness \t04:41 \t \n5. \tThe Lucifer's Call \t05:22 \t \n6. \tBlinded Slave \t04:52 \t \n7. \tRequiem \t06:15 \t \n8. \tDeath Serenade \t04:10 \t \n9. \tTenebra \t08:06 \t \n  \t47:08 \t \n\n\nLineup\n\nFrancesco Fusco \tDrums\nDanilo Carusone \tGuitars\nGiuseppe Rotolo \tGuitars\nRain \t                Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55971c58dd9b292b21f389a59aaf66603b12339a","amp;dn":"Enoch+-+Tenebra+2010+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55971c58dd9b292b21f389a59aaf66603b12339a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,151,28,88,221,155,41,43,33,243,137,165,154,175,102,96,59,18,51,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
