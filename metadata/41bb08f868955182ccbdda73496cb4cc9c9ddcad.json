The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.\n\n\n\n6)  Maintenance \nEvery night, 10,000 workers descend on the Tube to maintain, repair and clean it. We follow this invisible overnight army as they work against the clock in the four-hour window when the power is off - from hard-working Bulgarian cleaner Vladimir, who is amazed that the British government pays for people not to work, to 23-year-old Harry leading his gang of 'fluffers' picking fibres and lint from the tracks. Meanwhile, pest controller Mick is called to a smelly problem at Hounslow Central, while emergency response worker Roy gets inside one of the Underground's disused 'ghost' stations, Down Street.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1534 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:702 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41bb08f868955182ccbdda73496cb4cc9c9ddcad","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Tube+6of6+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41bb08f868955182ccbdda73496cb4cc9c9ddcad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,187,8,248,104,149,81,130,204,189,218,115,73,108,180,204,156,157,220,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
