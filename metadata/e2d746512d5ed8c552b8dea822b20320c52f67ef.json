The intention is to provide a fairly good skill in manipulating with those concepts formally.\n\nThis text differs from most other introductions to category theory in the calculational style of the proofs, the restriction to applications within algorithmics, and the omission of many additional concepts and facts that I consider not helpful in a first introduction to category theory.\n\n80 Pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d746512d5ed8c552b8dea822b20320c52f67ef","amp;dn":"A+Gentle+Introduction+to+Category+Theory+-+The+Calculational+App","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d746512d5ed8c552b8dea822b20320c52f67ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,215,70,81,45,94,216,197,82,184,222,168,34,178,3,32,197,47,103,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
