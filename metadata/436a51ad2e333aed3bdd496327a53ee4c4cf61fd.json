This two disc set is pretty extensive featuring tracks all the way back to &amp;#039;80. The 24 page full color booklet includes liner notes about each song, written by Iron Maiden&amp;#039;s manager and long time friend Rod Smallwood. This made for an interesting read even before I put the CD into the deck. The booklet also includes shots of all the different album covers from the various singles that the tracks were taken from. Lots of killer tracks included on this disc, many of which were released in the Castle 2-CD re-issues in 1995. However, it&amp;#039;s nice to have all these rare tracks on one disc. Of particular interest to me are the many cover songs. Two Montrose tracks &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got the Fire&quot; and &quot;Space Station No. 5&quot;, Jethro Tull-&quot;Cross Eyed Mary&quot;, Beckett-&quot;A Rainbow&amp;#039;s Gold&quot;, Nektar &quot;King of Twilight&quot;, Marshall Fury-&quot;Juanita&quot;, Stray-&quot;All In Your Mind&quot;, Golden Earring &quot;Kill Me Ce Soir&quot;, Free-&quot;I&amp;#039;m A Mover,&quot; Led Zeppelin-&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, Budgie- &quot;I Can&amp;#039;t See My Feelings&quot;, The Who-&quot;My Generation&quot; and UFO&amp;#039;s &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;. On top of this there are some live rarities and studio outtakes. My only complaint is that Maiden&amp;#039;s most awesome cover ever was left off; Thin Lizzy&amp;#039;s &quot;Massacre.&quot; Oh well, guess you can&amp;#039;t have everything. &quot;Cross Eyed Mary&quot; is still among my favorite Iron Maiden covers of all time. The liner notes state that despite the fact that this song was never released as a single, it is one of the few song to gain radio airplay in the U.S. when it was released as the b-side to &quot;The Trooper&quot; in &amp;#039;83. Apparently, because of this, the record company executives tried to convince Steve Harris to release the song as a single. Steve refused on the grounds that the track did not really represent the band&amp;#039;s sound.\nDisc Two features several stellar b-side songs and about half a disc of Blaze Bailey material, including two tracks that were recorded for X-Factor but not included on that disc (&quot;Justice of the Peace&quot; &amp; &quot;Judgement Day&quot;). As might be expected these are probably the weakest tracks on the disc. However, Blaze sound especially strong on the smokin&amp;#039; rendition of &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;. Also included are live versions of Blaze-era songs &quot;Blood on the World&amp;#039;s Hands&quot;, &quot;The Aftermath&quot; and &quot;Futureal.&quot; The first two are both off the &quot;X-Factor&quot; and feature Blaze Bailey on vocals. I never have been much of a fan of the X-Factor material but I did enjoy these live tracks. &quot;Futureal&quot; recorded live, features Bruce Dickinson on vocals. This is actually one of the tracks I did like from the Blaze-era of the band. Bruce does a good job but amazingly sings the song very much like Blaze. As a matter of fact, on first listen I didn&amp;#039;t even realize it was Bruce. The disc finishes off with a charged-up live version of &quot;Wasted Years&quot; with Bruce on vocals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:436a51ad2e333aed3bdd496327a53ee4c4cf61fd","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Best+Of+The+B%5C%27Sides+CD2+%28Eddie%5C%27s+Archive+CD6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"436a51ad2e333aed3bdd496327a53ee4c4cf61fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,106,81,173,46,51,58,237,59,221,73,99,39,165,62,228,196,207,97,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
