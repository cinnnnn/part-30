Some fighters are their own creations, while some fight in return for answers to their own dilemmas.\n\nWritten by Art Holcomb, with art provided by Bart Sears, Sean Chen, Steven Butler, Dale Eaglesham, Doug Tropea-Wheatley, Scot Eaton and David Boller.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7ca10b51d942391fed5ec2de100e5883774866","amp;dn":"Killer+Instinct+%28Acclaim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7ca10b51d942391fed5ec2de100e5883774866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,124,161,11,81,217,66,57,31,237,94,194,222,16,14,88,131,119,72,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
