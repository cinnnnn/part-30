Dumas (Author)\nHardcover: 432 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press (September 27, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300166346\nISBN-13: 978-0300166347\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nThe idea that military strength is virtually synonymous with security is deeply entrenched and widely held. But while the threat or use of military force may sometimes be necessary, it cannot keep us as safe as we would be by building relationships that replace hostility with a sense of mutual purpose and mutual gain. Economic relationships, says Lloyd J. Dumas, can offer a far more effective, and far less costly, means of maintaining security. After defining the right kind of economic relationshipÃ¢â‚¬â€one that is balanced and nonexploitative, emphasizes development, and minimizes environmental damageÃ¢â‚¬â€Dumas then addresses some practical concerns in establishing and maintaining these relationships. He also considers the practical problems of the transition from military-based security arrangements to &quot;economic peacekeeping,&quot; and the effects of demilitarized security on economic development and prosperity.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nLloyd J. Dumas is Professor of Political Economy, Economics and Public Policy at the University of Texas, Dallas. He lives in Carrollton, TX.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b3058c2bf33e8b20502f7ead7a912e83eb33c76","amp;dn":"Lloyd+J.+Dumas+-+The+Peacekeeping+Economy+%5B2011%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b3058c2bf33e8b20502f7ead7a912e83eb33c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,48,88,194,191,51,232,178,5,2,247,234,215,169,18,232,62,179,60,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
