Because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not really luck thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got these three musos to where they are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ igniting South African night skies with their jazzing beats- itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more like a blend of serious sums of talent, plenty of soul and a helluva lot of passion.  And their next plan? Taking over the dance floors of the world!\nAnd theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not far off. Because this band is seriousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ serious about being themselves, playing from the heart and having a good time. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really why theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re here.  With a sound that blends electro beats with the distinctive sounds of sax, drums and keyboard, their music just makes you feel so good!\n\nFiles:\n\\Album Art\n*Front Cover Art.jpg\n*Rear Cover Art.jpg\n\\Goodluck\\Goodluck\n*01 Hop on Hop off.wma\n*02 London Sixteen66.wma\n*03 Taking it Easy.wma\n*04 Stars In My Eyes.wma\n*05 The Vision.wma\n*06 Electro Thing.wma\n*07 Durty Boys.wma\n*08 Harlem.wma\n*09 Jazzy Fizzle.wma\n*10 Bounce Me Brother.wma\n*11 London Sixteen66 (Remix).wma\n*12 Kissed in Soho.wma\n\\Goodluck\\Goodluck\n*01 hop on hop off l&amp;v remix.wma\n*02 london sixteen66 wc mix.wma\n*03 taking it easy 808 remix.wma\n*04 hop on hop off p&amp;p mix.wma\n*05 london sixteen66 sn mix.wma\n*06 taking it easy dj mix.wma\n*07 the vision 808 remix.wma\n*08 hop on hop off st remix.wma\n*09 taking it easy dj q remix.wma\n*10 the vision mi remix.wma\n\nThis is my first Torrent as it is the first time I have seen something that I have that is not yet on TPB. So let me know what you think or if you need anything else :) Also, Don't forget that if you like the Artist support them and buy the album, these guys deserve it :)\n\nP.S. I have got some of the worst internet in the world. Have patience, I will seed for as long as it takes but it will never exceed about 20kbps upload from my side unfortunately. Good things come to those who wait....\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f337853db3fa4a93b050930fbc2a4d399951ac31","amp;dn":"GoodLuck+%282011%29+CDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f337853db3fa4a93b050930fbc2a4d399951ac31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,55,133,61,179,250,74,147,176,80,147,15,188,42,77,57,153,81,172,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
