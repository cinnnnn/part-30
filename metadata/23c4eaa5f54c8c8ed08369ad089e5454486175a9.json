The event was published as two interlocking four-issue arcs involving the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and this one-volume collection puts them in reading order as well. Summary of the plot, from Comicvine - &quot;The appearance of twin colossal constructs known as the Harbingers of the Everlasting Winter signal the beginning of the end for humanity, unless the Earth's Mightiest Heroes and comicdom's First Family leap into the past and recover the key to the world's salvation!&quot;\n\nThanks to Kritter-DCP for compiling this together. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c4eaa5f54c8c8ed08369ad089e5454486175a9","amp;dn":"DCP+Archive+Edition+-+Domination+Factor+%281999%7CMarvel%7CKritter-DCP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c4eaa5f54c8c8ed08369ad089e5454486175a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,196,234,165,245,76,140,142,208,131,105,173,8,158,84,84,72,97,117,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
