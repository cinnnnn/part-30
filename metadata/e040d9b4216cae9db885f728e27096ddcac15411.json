Today, the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures continue in YOUNG JUSTICE #23.\n\nKylstar has imprisoned Superboy and four of the most powerful members of the Justice League on the moon! After he refuses to let them go, our heroes have no choice but to fight Kylestar for their freedom. Will they be strong enough to defeat him? Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter, The Flash and The Atom travel to Brainiac's spaceship to convince him to release Metropolis from his force field. Can they change his mind or are the city and the heroes trapped within it doomed?\n\nYOUNG JUSTICE #23, in stores today, is written by Greg Weisman and illustrated by Christopher Jones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e040d9b4216cae9db885f728e27096ddcac15411","amp;dn":"YOUNG+JUSTICE+023+%282013%29+%28DC%29+%28digital-TheGroup%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e040d9b4216cae9db885f728e27096ddcac15411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,64,217,180,33,108,174,157,184,133,247,40,226,112,150,221,202,193,84,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
