Farrel (Juan Fernandez) is a merchant sailor who has spent nearly all his adult life drifting from one job in one port to another. Farrel has never stayed in one place long enough to make many friends, and for all his freedom he's found little joy or contentment in his rootless existence. Farrel arrives in Ushuaia, a seaside city that's the closest thing he has to a home, and pays an unannounced visit to Trujillo (Nieves Cabrera), a longtime friend of his family. When Farrel went off to sea, Trujillo ended up looking after his daughter Analia (Giselle Irrazabal) when the girl's mother passed on. Trujillo feels a deep contempt for Farrel because of his failure to care for his own child, and while teenage Analia harbors her own resentments, a childhood without parental love or support has turned her into a young woman who has turned all her emotions in on herself. Liverpool was screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Liverpool-2008-Lisandro.Alonso.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 966 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1637 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 7.59 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n    Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1376 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 528 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.147\n      StreamSize : 809 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 254 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 149 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt1002539\n\nSpanidh audio, English and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4ae4729b300679530fcf15e4fc4740cec8739e","amp;dn":"Liverpool-2008-Lisandro.Alonso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4ae4729b300679530fcf15e4fc4740cec8739e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,74,228,114,155,48,6,121,83,15,207,21,228,252,71,64,206,200,115,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
