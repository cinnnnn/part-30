When the first edition published in 1984 we were both working in Patrick WallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laboratory at University College London, as postdoctoral fellow and medical student. Over the past two decades this book has flourished under the editorship of Pat Wall and Ron Melzack and established itself as the leading text in the field. It was their vision that an opus spanning the basic and clinical science of pain from bench to bedside would provide the field with a much needed resource. It was their authority that brought in one text the contributions of many of the key opinion leaders of the field. The\ndesire to forge together these two, sometimes antagonistic, branches of medicine can be seen from the beginning of PatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scientific career. Working in Oxford, he published his first two scientific papers in Nature and Brain, both then and now premier journals in science and neurology, respectively. While Pat was committed to the laboratory study of pain, he never lost sight of the clinical problems. His teaching regularly included walking with his students on the wards of University\nCollege Hospital and discussing with them the pain problems of the patients. It is therefore not surprising that so many basic scientists and clinicians alike readily acknowledge his numerous important contributions that provide the conceptual cornerstones of much\ncurrent activity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa5c7fb3eac8b9b159b9435de237d0c49f83b99","amp;dn":"McMahon+2006+Wall+and+Melzack%27s+Textbook+of+Pain+5th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa5c7fb3eac8b9b159b9435de237d0c49f83b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,165,199,251,62,172,139,155,21,155,148,53,222,35,125,12,73,248,59,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
