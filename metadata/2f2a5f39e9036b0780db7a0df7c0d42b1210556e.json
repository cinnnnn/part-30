At the age of six, he entered the great Sera Monastic University, Lhasa, where he studied until 1959, when the Chinese invasion of Tibet forced him into exile in India. Lama Yeshe continued to study and meditate in India until 1967, when, with his chief disciple, Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, he went to Nepal. Two years later he established Kopan Monastery, near Kathmandu, in order to teach Buddhism to Westerners.\n\nIn 1974, the Lamas began making annual teaching tours to the West, and as a result of these travels a worldwide network of Buddhist teaching and meditation centers?the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT)?began to develop.\n\nIn 1984, after an intense decade of imparting a wide variety of incredible teachings and establishing one FPMT activity after another, at the age of forty-nine, Lama Yeshe passed away. He was reborn as Ãƒâ€“sel Hita Torres in Spain in 1985, recognized as the incarnation of Lama Yeshe by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1986, and, as the monk Lama Tenzin Osel Rinpoche, began studying for his geshe degree in 1992 at the reconstituted Sera Monastery in South India. Lama?s remarkable story is told in Vicki Mackenzie?s book, Reincarnation: The Boy Lama (Wisdom Publications, 1996). \n\nThis is a small collection of some of his teachings as well as mantra chanting.\n\nThe list of tracks are:\n\nanim_bless_a - .mp3\neal_2 - .mp3\neal_3 - .mp3\neal_4 - .mp3\neal_5 - .mp3\neal_6 - .mp3\neal_7 - .mp3\nLama Lhundrup Rigsel_Everyday Advice_01_Everyday Advice - .mp3\nLama Thubten Yeshe_Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archives_01_Questions &amp; Answers - .mp3\nLama Thubten Yeshe_Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archives_01_The Six Perfections - .mp3\nLama Thubten Yeshe_Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archives_01_Three Principal Paths-1 - .mp3\nLama Thubten Yeshe_Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archives_02_Three Principal Paths-2 - .mp3\nLama Yeshe_Chap 2, Religion, The Path of Inquiry - .mp3\nLama Yeshe_Chap 3, A Glimpse of Buddhist Psychology - .mp3\nmanjushri_lung - .mp3\n              15 File(s)    187,693,684 bytes\n\nAccumulate merit - keep sharing.\n\nMetta!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2a5f39e9036b0780db7a0df7c0d42b1210556e","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+Lama+Thubten+Yeshe+Tibetan+Wisdom+Archives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2a5f39e9036b0780db7a0df7c0d42b1210556e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,42,95,57,233,3,107,7,128,219,122,13,247,192,212,43,18,16,85,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
