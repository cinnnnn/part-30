It goes beyond simply detecting and removing viruses on your PC by blocking infected links as you browse, checking files before they're downloaded, and helping protect your personal data online and on your PC with enhanced privacy features. With 2015, we've improved our core engine and its accuracy, and included a new cloud-based detection method. And because we know that security is just as important as usability, Internet Security 2015 features a revamped, easier-to-use design.\r\n\r\nWe've been hard at work optimizing our core engine to increase its detection accuracy. That includes better detection of screen-locker ransomware and improved scanning of all downloadable files to keep you safe from an exponentially expanding pool of threats.\r\n\r\nAnd when a new online threat breaks out and spreads, the key to keeping you protected is the speed with which we can react.
