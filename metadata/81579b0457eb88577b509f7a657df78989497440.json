Trained to use a secret military code based on their native language, it was the only one never broken by the Japanese and was key to winning the war in the Pacific. The Marines&amp;#039; mission was &quot;to protect the code at all costs&quot; but as the bonds of war are forged, how far will they go to stop the code falling into the enemies hands...\n\n\nStarring:\n\nNicholas Cage, Adam Beach, Peter Stormare and Noah Emmerich.\n\nEnjoy! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81579b0457eb88577b509f7a657df78989497440","amp;dn":"Windtalkers%5BCollectors.Edition%5D%7BAC3-5.1%7DDvdRip.Dino.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81579b0457eb88577b509f7a657df78989497440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,87,155,4,87,235,136,87,123,80,159,122,101,125,247,137,137,73,116,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
