Chris Breen showcases the required gear, from microphones to lights, and tours today's most popular screen capture software. He shows how to create a polished script, maintain a strong presence both on and off camera, and capture video and audio streams. He then reviews the process of editing the screencast in iMovie and integrating live video, screen captures, stills, and music to make the presentation even more appealing. This course illustrates how screencasts are the perfect form for anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€teachers, developers, even product managersÃ¢â‚¬â€to distribute information or instructions.\nTopics include:\nScripting a screencast\nCapturing video and audio using a screen capture utility\nShooting live video\nImporting assets and editing in iMovie\nRecording a separate narration track\nExporting and distributing a screencast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab9aeeca07c91aa66f5ed302348e12e45db714d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Screencasting+with+the+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab9aeeca07c91aa66f5ed302348e12e45db714d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,185,174,236,160,124,145,170,102,245,237,48,35,72,225,46,69,219,113,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
