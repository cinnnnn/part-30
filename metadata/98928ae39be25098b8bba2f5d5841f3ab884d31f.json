On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98928ae39be25098b8bba2f5d5841f3ab884d31f","amp;dn":"No+Ducks+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98928ae39be25098b8bba2f5d5841f3ab884d31f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,146,138,227,155,226,80,152,184,187,162,245,213,132,31,58,184,132,211,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
