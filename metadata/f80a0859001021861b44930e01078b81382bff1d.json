It addresses a very special use case of cloud gaming, where the game is rendered at \na server and audio and video are streamed to the client.\n\n* Protected Mode for Firefox - Flash Player Protected Mode is a new security enhancement designed to limit the impact of \nattacks launched from malicious SWF files against Adobe Flash Player when running in Firefox 4.0 + on Windows Vista and \nhigher.
