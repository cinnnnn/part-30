The folder list below gives U an idea of what kind of icons they are. 10,000 of them. (I know I am just sniveling here)\n\n\n================================\nBut one folder named HANDFEVIL has the Dungeon Keepers Hand...\nHANDOFEVIL contains animated gif files of the hand of the Dungeon keeper that slaps those imps and trolls and generally good therapy for all. From the game Dungeon Keeper. Like I said, old school...\nI renamed the animated gifs to a file type named agif since the file is Animated Gif files, right?) Ahe sub folders inside that HANDOFEVIL  folder contain the frame by frame graphics used to compile the agif animated files. Man I had way too much time on my hands. Its good to be bad, says the Dungeon Keeper\n================================\n\nBetween the icons and the hand they amount to about 20.5 megs compressed into a 7 meg zip folder. \nYour pc or mac wont know what to do with agif files so click and drag one to firefox or your browser U like and hey here is a hint; animate gif editor or rename them as  wish..  I dont care they are yours. I typed in gif animator in The Pirate bay and discovered that you won't have a problem playing with them.\nThere is no executable code here so U won't find a virus. \n\n Aaagems\n Airicons\n Animals\n Animated\n Buttons\n Computers\n Faces\n Folders\n Fricons\n Games\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HANDOFEVIL\n Holiday\n Icons A-Z\n Icons Others\n Icons-1- 5\n Icospell\n Movie Stuff\n Music Stuff\n Radnhzrd\n Robotic\n Scenes\n Sci-Fi\n Sports\n Stuff Stuff\n Toons\n Transportation\n War\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a29933bc7207b574037e08a90706840ce326645","amp;dn":"The+Hand+Of+The+Dungeon+Keeper+and+10%2C000+useless+icons+from+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a29933bc7207b574037e08a90706840ce326645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,41,147,59,199,32,123,87,64,55,224,138,144,112,104,64,206,50,102,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
