Its state of the art filter creates effects from Van Gogh's painterly style to the harsh and gritty film noir look of Frank Miller.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Eight photo layouts.\n    A highly customizable filter that lets you achieve a range of creative effects such as graphic novel, woodcut, pencil and oil-painting.\n    Customizable caption for each panel in the layout.\n    A gallery for viewing your stylized images.\n    New features and improvements are in the works so keep watching this space!\n\nAs always we love to hear what our users think. Please feel free to contact us with ideas and comments. We value your feedback!\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 16, 2012)\n\n    Bugfix : Users experiencing forced close when applying filter and tweaks mulitiple times - this has now been fixed. Thanks to Laura, Sunder, Henry, Bobby, Derek and others for tracking that one down!\n    Improved sharing support. You should now be able to share on most platforms now, e.g. google+, sms etc. Thanks dweb13!\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64ef74ae1ba273dce0cf449af1d332ef8a19435","amp;dn":"Lithic+v1.5+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64ef74ae1ba273dce0cf449af1d332ef8a19435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,78,247,74,225,186,39,61,206,12,244,73,175,29,51,46,248,161,148,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
