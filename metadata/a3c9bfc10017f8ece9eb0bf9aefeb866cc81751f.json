Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.\n\nIn 2001, PhotoRescue introduced the first affordable and fair &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; picture and photo data recovery solution. PhotoRescue will undelete, unerase and recover pictures, images, photos and files lost on corrupted, erased or damaged compact flash (CF) cards, SD Cards, Memory Sticks, SmartMedia and XD cards even when other solutions fail. Data Recovery is not always possible, but once we recover data, we do guarantee its integrity: once the demo previews your pic, they will be recovered and usable full size or you get your money back (see our refund policy).\n\nPhotoRescue supports the recovery of all file types but its algorithms are particularly optimized for JPG/JPEG files, TIFF files, GIFs and BMPs. It also offers a constantly updated support for most camera's RAW file formats: CR2, RAW, RAF, CRW, NEF, ORF, MRW, etc and many types of movie files. In some cases, we can even rebuild pictures that have suffered minor corruptions.\n\nIf your card is damaged, corrupted, or has been formatted, PhotoRescue is the best data-recovery solution you can get: it consistently beats other solutions in independent tests. PhotoRescue even deals with cases where the media is NOT visible as a drive letter anymore but is still electrically responsive. We get at the pictures other recovery software does not even see. Our unique unfragmenting technology rebuilds cherished memories that would otherwise have been lost forever. \n\ncheck it out:-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datarescue.com/photorescue/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datarescue.com/photorescue/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c9bfc10017f8ece9eb0bf9aefeb866cc81751f","amp;dn":"PhotoRescue+Advanced+v2.1.700.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c9bfc10017f8ece9eb0bf9aefeb866cc81751f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,201,191,193,0,23,248,236,233,235,11,249,174,254,184,102,204,129,117,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
