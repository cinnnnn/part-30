I've included a couple of remixes not on CM, some things he produced for other artists, some B-sides, some tracks that were live-only- it holds together nicely and feels like a cohesive body of work. Enjoy and seed for others. \n\n\nTracklisting: \n\nIntro\nElastic Girl\nBall In - Kick Off\nTypewriter Lesson\nSeashore and Horizon (Demo)\nApe Shall Never Kill Ape (live) \nMilk Rock\nPink Spider\nLe Roi Soleil \nWorld's End Humming \nE\nFantasmo \n\nHey! I also created album artwork!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c35d1f758e3bf0c2f815e2a7b349cb195ed3c4","amp;dn":"FANTASMO+by+Cornelius+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c35d1f758e3bf0c2f815e2a7b349cb195ed3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,195,93,31,117,142,59,240,194,248,21,226,167,179,73,203,25,94,211,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
