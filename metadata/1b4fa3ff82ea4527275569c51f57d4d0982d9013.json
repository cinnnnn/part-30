Although House finds himself \nback on familiar ground, he quickly \nrealizes that much has changed since \nhe left, and he is forced to work on \nthe case with smart yet timid \nresident Dr. Chi Park. After several \ninconclusive treatments and with time \nrunning out, House and Dr. Park are \nleft with one last option to examine \nthe patient's medical history that \ncould compromise House's conditional \nagreement with the hospital. \nMeanwhile, House makes an effort to \nreconnect with Wilson despite a cold \nreception.\n\n18/Slower\nEvolve...or die.\n\nEnjoy :)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4fa3ff82ea4527275569c51f57d4d0982d9013","amp;dn":"House.S08E02.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4fa3ff82ea4527275569c51f57d4d0982d9013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,79,163,255,130,234,69,39,39,85,105,197,31,87,212,208,152,45,144,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
