Basically, please keep it civil.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nFair warning: These are Christian/religious books. Although written by Basil Wolverton himself, this is full-on ministering of the Bible. Personally, from a study standpoint, I found what I read to be interesting and informative. However, Basil Wolverton was a member of a millenarian evangelical church called the Worldwide Church of God, a sect that believed in obeying Old Testament lifestyle laws and the literal truth of Revelations. As such, these books are very, VERY Christian in nature.\n\nWeirdly, or maybe not, the series contains HUNDREDS of the most beautiful images Basil Wolverton ever created. Perfect perspective, wonderfully emotive faces, brilliant use of pointillism and cross-hatching. Definitely worth checking out for the art alone. And if it's your thing, maybe get in some good reading at the same time. If not, I'll upload the art book that was published with these images eventually.\n\nThe Bible Story\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Basil Wolverton\n\nWorldwide Church of God, 1982-1988, 220-223 pages each\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://herbert-w-armstrong.com/bible_story.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://herbert-w-armstrong.com/bible_story.html&lt;/a&gt; (the files in this upload are of a much better quality than those available at the website)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e78cfe7738618a31569925c68dd99cb0657b8f","amp;dn":"Basil+Wolverton+-+The+Bible+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e78cfe7738618a31569925c68dd99cb0657b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,231,140,254,119,56,97,138,49,86,153,37,198,141,217,156,176,101,123,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
