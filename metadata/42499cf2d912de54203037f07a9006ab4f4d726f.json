Elsewhere, the title track is an only partially accurate satire of punk; Zappa's intentionally smarmy crowd banter is featured on &quot;Dance Contest&quot; and &quot;Panty Rap,&quot; the latter a bit involving the collection of female audience members' underwear. More problematic is the sometimes violent sexual juvenilia of songs like &quot;Fine Girl,&quot; &quot;Easy Meat,&quot; &quot;Pick Me, I'm Clean,&quot; and &quot;Bamboozled by Love&quot;; if, as Zappa insisted, this part of his oeuvre simply mixes dumb fun and satire of both sexes' peccadillos, with no underlying misogyny, it's rather difficult to tell.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
