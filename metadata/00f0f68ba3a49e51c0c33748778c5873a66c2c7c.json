With nearly one hundred color photographs, Adams demonstrates through his own work how to capture the beauty of the seasons when photographing OhioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s covered bridges, numerous public gardens, state parks, and nature preserves. Each entry includes clear directions, related websites, and historical facts about the area, as well as AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suggestions for capturing the best image.\n\nBoth amateur and experienced photographers will find expert guidance in AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear instructions on digital photography and will be inspired to create their own stunning close-ups and scenic panoramas.
