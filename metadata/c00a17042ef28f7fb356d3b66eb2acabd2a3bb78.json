With a really authentic punk rock sound.\n\nWhen I first started to listen to these guys, I thought I had taken a trip back in time, when Punk Rock was in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prime with The Ramones or The Clash. I was actually blown away by their music.\n\nSuburban Vermin basically has everything you could ask for from a band; great vocals, awesome instrumental skills, sick ass lyrics and a truly kick ass sound. With the ability to make music comparable to Artists such as the Ramones, is quite a feat. Overall this band is really awesome and I for one have become a long time fan.&quot; - Punkreviews.net (http://punkreviews.net/?p=198)\n\n&quot;Suburban Vermin, Danger and Destiny (8/10, self-released, suburbanvermin.com): Six songs of no-frills punk rock with dueling male/female vocals that don't fall squarely into either Ramones-core or old-school skate-punk territory, but somewhere in between. Bonus points for singer/guitarist Amanda Gamino's voice sounding a lot like that of Kim Shattuck of the Muffs.
