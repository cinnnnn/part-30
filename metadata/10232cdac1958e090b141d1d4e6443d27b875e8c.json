Similar\nin content but very different in style from his earlier work.\nAlthough unfinished, the published parts were polished to TSE's\nusual standard. They stand alone.\n\nThe work is now seen as merely the prototype for his later plays.\nBut it was much more than that - matching solemn themes to jazzy\ntempos was a radical idea. TSE did return to this approach, but\nnever again with such contrast.\n\nProbably best known now through parodies of Eliot's style. It's\ntoo short to merit a full scale stage production. This radio\nadaption is an opportunity to hear the play as TSE intended.\n\nCast \nSweeney - Malcolm Storry\nDusty - Denise Black\nDoris - Patsy Rowlands\nKrumpacker - John Branwell\nKlipstein - Michael Maloney\nWauchope - Nigel Carrington\n\nMusicians\nJeff Box - Double-bass\nSimon Butterworth - Reeds\nRichard Davis - Flute\nDavid Fletcher - Cello\nPaul Patrick - Percussion\nBernard Robertson - Piano\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10232cdac1958e090b141d1d4e6443d27b875e8c","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+-+T+S+Eliot%5C%27s+%5C%27Sweeney+Agonistes%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10232cdac1958e090b141d1d4e6443d27b875e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,35,44,218,193,149,142,9,11,20,29,29,78,100,67,210,123,135,94,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
