If only he knew what his victims looked like.Plagued with a rare disease that prevents him from recognizing faces, Billy carries a photograph in his pocket that is his only way of identifying his next target. Killing is in Billy's bloodline, as a member of Philadelphia's dangerous Farren crime family.\r\nWhile Billy stalks Philadelphia, Detective Kevin Byrne is assigned to a series of bizarre home-invasion cases and is joined by his former partner-turned-assistant district attorney, Jessica Balzano. Their investigations circle Byrne's childhood neighborhood of Devil's Pocket, and they find themselves revisiting a crime from Byrne's past that has haunted him for decades. What Byrne witnessed as a child in Devil's Pocket jeopardizes the Farren family--which makes him the next target on Billy's hit list","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35eae515d35f02451f59176b8d715ebb405c6fc","amp;dn":"Richard+Montanari-Shutter+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35eae515d35f02451f59176b8d715ebb405c6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,94,174,81,93,53,240,36,81,245,145,118,184,215,21,235,180,5,198,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
