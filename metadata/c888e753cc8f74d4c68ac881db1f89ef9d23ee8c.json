This is an ultra rare CD, out of print and impossible to come by. For those who have no clue who Polyrock is: Polyrock was a post-punk-new wave band formed in New York City in 1978. The group was produced by the composer Philip Glass and Kurt Munkacsi. The band, led by singer/guitarist Billy Robertson (formerly of the group Model Citizen), had a keyboard-heavy sound. Polyrock's lineup also included vocalist Catherine Oblasney, guitarist Tommy Robertson, drummer Joseph Yannece, keyboard player Lenny Aaron, and Curt Cosentino. It remains to-date one of the most underrated and criminally forgotten new wave bands of the 80s. Their music and sound is so brilliant and unique.\n\n01 Romantic Me\n02 The New U.S.\n03 Chains Of Iron\n04 Changing Hearts\n05 Love Song\n06 Working On My Love\n07 No Love Lost\n08 Broken China\n09 This Song\n10 Body Me\n11 In Full Circle\n12 Call Of The Wild\n13 Go West\n14 Like Papers On A Rack\n15 Cries And Whispers\n16 Green For Go\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c888e753cc8f74d4c68ac881db1f89ef9d23ee8c","amp;dn":"Polyrock+-+The+Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c888e753cc8f74d4c68ac881db1f89ef9d23ee8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,136,231,83,204,143,116,212,198,138,200,129,219,31,137,239,157,35,238,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
