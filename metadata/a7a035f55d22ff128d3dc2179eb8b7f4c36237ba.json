The book's 15 general chemistry and 20 organic/biochemistry safety-scale laboratory experiments use small quantities of chemicals and emphasize safety and proper disposal of materials. &quot;Safety-scale' is the authors' own term for describing the amount of chemicals each lab experiment requires--less than macroscale quantities, which are expensive and hazardous, and more than microscale quantities, which are difficult to work with and require special equipment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a035f55d22ff128d3dc2179eb8b7f4c36237ba","amp;dn":"Safety-Scale+Laboratory+Experiments+for+Chemistry+for+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a035f55d22ff128d3dc2179eb8b7f4c36237ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,160,53,245,93,34,255,18,141,61,194,23,158,184,183,244,195,98,55,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
