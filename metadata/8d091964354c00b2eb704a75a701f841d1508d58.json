The receptionist is clearly smarter than the boss who earns fifty times her salary. Arbitrary lines starkly divide the desirable districts of the city from the dangerous ones. Voters flock to the polling booths to elect candidates whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll rip them off to favour special interests. None of it makes logical sense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or does it?\n\nEconomist and acclaimed author Tim Harford thinks it does. By weaving stories from locations as diverse as a Vegas casino to a barroom speed date, Harford aims to persuade you that people are, in fact, surprisingly logical.\n\nWhen a street prostitute agrees to unprotected sex, or a teenage criminal embarks on a burglary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perhaps especially when a racist employer disregards a black job applicant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we would seem to be a million miles from rational behaviour. Harford shows that, discomfitingly, we are not. It turns out that the unlikeliest of people are complying with the logic of economics and responding to future costs and benefits, often without realizing it; and socially tragic outcomes can have their roots in individually rational decisions.\n\nBrilliantly reasoned, always entertaining and often provocative, The Logic of Life is a book to help you understand yourself and the world around you.\n\nJanuary 2008\nPublisher: Random House Publishing Group\nFormat: Hardcover 272pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d091964354c00b2eb704a75a701f841d1508d58","amp;dn":"The+Logic+of+Life%3A+The+Rational+Economics+of+an+Irrational+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d091964354c00b2eb704a75a701f841d1508d58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,9,25,100,53,76,0,178,235,112,74,117,167,1,248,65,209,80,141,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
