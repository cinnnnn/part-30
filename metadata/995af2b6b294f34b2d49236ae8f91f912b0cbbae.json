Lines are crossed.\r\nWalls are smashed. Good becomes bad.\r\nBad becomes very, very good.\r\n\r\nShayda Hijaziâ€”the perfect wife, the perfect mother, the perfect daughter. For thirty-three years, she has played by the rules, swallowing secrets, burying dreams and doing whatever it takes to anchor her family. Shayda Hijazi is about to come face to face with the one thing that can rip it all apart, the one thing her heart has always been denied: Love.\r\n\r\nTroy Heathgateâ€”untamed, exhilarating, dangerousâ€”a man who does exactly as he pleases. Life bends to his will. Until he comes across the one thing he would give it all up for, but can never have.\r\n\r\nBorn on the same day in opposite corners of the world, their lives collide. And nothing is ever the same again.\r\n\r\nSpanning three decades, 53 Letters for My Lover is a fiercely sensual, emotional ride to the heart of an epic, forbidden love that defies it allâ€”an intimate exploration of love, loyalty, passion, betrayal, and the human journey for hope, happiness and redemption.\r\n\r\nFrom His Lips [53 Letters For My Lover, #01.5] - Leylah Attar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTroy Heathgate has it all - brains, brawn and the kind of smile that just begs a ribbon.

It is meant to be read after the full length novel, 53 Letters For My Lover. For readers who want more from the hero's point of view.
