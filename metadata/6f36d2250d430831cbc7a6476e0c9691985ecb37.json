This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThis is the first time in chart history that someone ever got bounced out of the number one spot by a cousin!\n\nSomeone writes in with this question; &quot;For the rock era, what man and what woman have had the most number one hits in any 12 month period?&quot;\n\nSo far in the 80's, only two teen-age solo acts have hit the top 40. One of them is in this countdown.\n\nCasey pays tribute to Janis Joplin.\n\nHe also gives a special report about a man who hit the chart as a solo act, as a duo, and as a trio, but he was the only performer each time!\n\nOne singer in the top ten grew up in a shack that his family rented for just seven dollars a month.\n\n40: Let's Go All The Way - Sly Fox\n39: (How To Be A) Millionaire - ABC\n38: Another Night - Aretha Franklin\n37: R.O.C.K.
