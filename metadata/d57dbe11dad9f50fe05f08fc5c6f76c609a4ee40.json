The city of young lovers, dark secrets,\nand intoxicating new desireÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I thought I knew what\nI wanted in life. I thought my destiny was set.\nThen I met him, and everything changed. Raphael is\nbold, passionate, and seductive. He sees something\nin me I never dreamed possible, and now he's\ndetermined to show me a world beyond rules -- a\ndance without limits. I want to trust him, but I'm\nscared. Because I know once I fall, there'll be no\ngoing back. An innocent dancer. A mysterious\nstranger. As Annalise is drawn deeper into the\nsensual delights of Rome, she'll question everything\nshe believed about her future. But with opening night\nlooming, can she find the strength to risk it all?\nAnd will she be forced to choose between her one true\nlove, ballet, and the new passion in her heart?\n\n\nWith Every Heartbeat (Cities of Love #1)\nby Melody Grace\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 372\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57dbe11dad9f50fe05f08fc5c6f76c609a4ee40","amp;dn":"With+Every+Heartbeat+%28Cities+of+Love+%231%29+by+Melody+Grace+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57dbe11dad9f50fe05f08fc5c6f76c609a4ee40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,125,190,17,218,217,245,15,224,95,8,252,92,111,118,198,9,164,238,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
