No sooner have I appreciated\r\nsoprano-tenor voice Alexandra Grimal on a duet album for Ayler Records (see\r\nGapplegate Music Review article published this month) than she is back again\r\nvery prominently and nicely, in duet with avant bass-master Benjamin Duboc, on\r\na two-cd set le retour d'Ulysse (Improvising Beings ib32).\r\n\r\nThis outing has the free jazz element out front, with plenty of space for both\r\nplayers in tandem and in themselves. I've been digging Benjamin Duboc for a\r\nwhile now--and you may note I named his solo album the bass offering of the\r\nyear last December (see December 2014 listings). Alexandra I am really getting\r\ninto as well now. The pairing of the two is good for them both and good for us,\r\nthe listeners.\r\n\r\nThey give us a full-blown free program with the accent on spontaneous\r\ncombustion. Both are hearing and playing with close focus and the results are\r\nrather magical. It's primo, no bs jazz declamation.\r\n\r\nAnd for that it is exemplary for what a reedwoman and a bassist can do when let\r\nloose. Alexandra has arrived. Benjamin sets a place beside himself and they dig\r\nin with gusto!\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/04/benjamin-duboc-alexandra-grimal-le.html\r\n\r\nBy Jan Granlie (no) \nhttp://salt-peanuts.eu/record/benjamin-duboc-alexandra-grimal/\r\n\r\nPar Pierre Gros (fr) \nhttp://www.culturejazz.fr/spip.php?article2657\r\n\r\nPar Franpi Barriaux (fr) \nhttp://www.franpisunship.com/archives/2015/03/24/31752739.html\r\n\r\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6918a4b5486ae2d878f54f5d212dea48d772762f","amp;dn":"Benjamin+Duboc%2C+Alexandra+Grimal+-+Le+retour+d%27Ulysse+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6918a4b5486ae2d878f54f5d212dea48d772762f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,24,164,181,72,106,226,216,120,245,79,93,33,45,234,72,215,114,118,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
