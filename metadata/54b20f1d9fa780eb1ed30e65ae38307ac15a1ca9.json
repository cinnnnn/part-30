The New York Times called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa bible of the vegan community.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When it first appeared in 1990, Library Journal called The Sexual Politics of Meat \\\\\\&quot;an important and provocative work\\\\\\&quot; and predicted it would \\\\\\&quot;inspire and enrage readers across the political spectrum.\\\\\\&quot; True to Library Journal\\\\\\'s prediction, the book was hailed by CHOICE as a \\\\\\&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢bible\\\\\\' for feminist and progressive animal rights activists\\\\\\&quot; and equally reviled by conservative commentators, including Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe appearance of The Sexual Politics of Meat triggered dramatic international media coverage of the book. Polity Press in the United Kingdom immediately issued a British Edition. Full page articles appeared in Australian and Dutch newspapers; reviews appeared in Italy and Norway as well as in Great Britain and the United States. The Kirkus Review concluded that it was \\\\\\&quot;an intelligent polemic...Adams\\\\\\'s observations are telling, most are seductively sprung...the argument is both thoughtful and thought-provoking.\\\\\\&quot; Publisher\\\\\\'s Weekly observed that \\\\\\&quot;Carol J. Adams\\\\\\'s original, provocative book makes a major contribution to the debate on animal rights.\\\\\\&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b20f1d9fa780eb1ed30e65ae38307ac15a1ca9","amp;dn":"Carol+Adams+-+The+Sexual+Politics+of+Meat%3A+A+Feminist-Vegetarian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b20f1d9fa780eb1ed30e65ae38307ac15a1ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,178,15,29,159,167,128,235,30,211,14,101,174,56,48,122,193,90,28,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
