ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a great outlet \t \nfor their creativity, one that lends itself to wild flights of fancy. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \t \nalso a wonderful vehicle for personal expression, more so now than ever \t \nin this age of e-mail. \t \nBut writing is also tough. Simply staring at a blank piece of paper is no \t \nway to get started. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just too discouraging, when what is needed is \t \nencouragement and plenty of it. If only kids can start with the seed of an \t \nidea, their imaginations can flower. Writing can become an activity thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \t \nboth exciting and enriching. \t \nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the purpose of the prompts contained in this book. Think of them \t \nas a little push to help your students get started, the same kind of push \t \nthat any writerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even the most gifted veteranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½naturally needs. \t \nThe prompts are organized by the ten months of the school year. Most of \t \nthem are tied to specific events in a given month. For example, October \t \nincludes a selection of Halloween-related prompts and June is full of those \t \nwith summer themes. There are also prompts pegged to the anniversaries \t \nof historic happenings, like the Wright BrothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ famous flight (December \t \n17); prompts tied to the birthdays of famous childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s authors such as \t \nTheodor Geisel (March 2); and even some that relate to unusual dates \t \nsuch as Elephant Appreciation Day (September 22). \t \nKids will find that the prompts send them off in all kinds of directions, \t \nurging them to write stories, poems, songs, and mini-essays. The emphasis \t \nis on varietyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½interesting exercises spur interesting writing. Kids are even \t \nencouraged to write rap songs, e-mails, petitions, sports stories, and gos-\t \nsip columnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all in an effort to get those creative juices flowing. \t \n\nIt doesn't say in the book; but I would guess this would be good for students from grades 3 to 6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:829b91fea003d319d69a1f2fb6bd5f3bf7bc528e","amp;dn":"250+Writing+Prompts+-+Month+by+Month","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"829b91fea003d319d69a1f2fb6bd5f3bf7bc528e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,155,145,254,160,3,211,25,214,154,31,47,182,189,95,59,247,188,82,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
