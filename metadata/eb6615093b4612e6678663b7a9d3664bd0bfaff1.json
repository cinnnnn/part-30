It combines a fondness for alien invader science-fiction with good old-fashioned anti-Communist paranoia and a hippieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of sex, jokes, and sly humor.\n\nTed Boxell was the organizing force behind this anthology series, and he invited a collection of underground comic artists to contribute short stories to each issue. Although all based around the theme of Communist invaders from Mars, each has its own take on the subject. Expect to see everything from depictions of President Reagan as a Martian lizard creature, to lowbrow alien sex strips, to truly devilish tales of Martians using our own stupidity to help them destroy our world.\n\nIssues 1-6. Copmplete series I believe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6615093b4612e6678663b7a9d3664bd0bfaff1","amp;dn":"Commies+From+March+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6615093b4612e6678663b7a9d3664bd0bfaff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,102,21,9,59,70,18,230,103,134,99,183,169,211,102,75,208,191,175,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
