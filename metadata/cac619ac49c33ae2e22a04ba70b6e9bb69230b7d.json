While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace. \n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cac619ac49c33ae2e22a04ba70b6e9bb69230b7d","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cac619ac49c33ae2e22a04ba70b6e9bb69230b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,198,25,172,73,195,58,226,226,42,4,186,112,182,233,187,105,35,11,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
