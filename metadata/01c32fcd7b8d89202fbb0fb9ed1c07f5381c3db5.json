I have packed the website version of the comic into .cbr to correct this problem. :)\n\nI'm sorry, but the resolution (674x977) isn't what is generally expected of .cbr comics, because Capcom didn't appear to provide high-resolution versions of the comic on the site.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c32fcd7b8d89202fbb0fb9ed1c07f5381c3db5","amp;dn":"Bionic+Commando+-+Chain+of+Command+prequel+comic+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c32fcd7b8d89202fbb0fb9ed1c07f5381c3db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,195,47,205,123,141,137,32,47,187,15,185,237,28,7,245,56,28,61,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
