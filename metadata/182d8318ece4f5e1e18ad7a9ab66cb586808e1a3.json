His dream is to be become one of the Knights of Valour, like his grandfather was, but his father REGINALD, the chief counsel to the QUEEN, wants his son to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer. After an inspiring visit to his beloved GRANDMOTHER and bidding farewell to his supposed lady-love LARA, JUSTIN leaves home and embarks on a quest to become a knight. Along the way he meets the beautiful, feisty TALIA, a quirky wizard called MELQUIADES, the handsome SIR CLOREX and is mentored by three monks; BLUCHER, LEGANTIR and BRAULIO, who teach and test him in the ancient ways of the Knights of Valour. Whilst an unlikely candidate for knighthood, JUSTIN must rise to the challenge quickly when banished former knight SIR HERACLIO and his army, lead by SOTA, return and threaten to destroy the Kingdom.
