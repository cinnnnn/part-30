Although it is an armature recording of non-professional singers, the quality is very clear and satisfying.  As there is a lot of repetition in this kind of music, you really don't need a song sheet to follow along.  There are about 40 songs lasting about 2 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ hours in total.   It is in m4b audiobook format at 128 kbps which will play nicely on iPhone, iPod, iPad, or most computers.  In audiobook format you can jump easily between the songs as you would between chapters of a book.  To make a CD of the music or convert to mp3 files, you would need a conversion program such as SUPER (which can be found for free).
