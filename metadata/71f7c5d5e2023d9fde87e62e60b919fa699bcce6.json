The 30-minute television event will provide\nfans with the first televised peek at the band's sold-out, critically lauded\nEuropean &quot;Fragility&quot; tour.\n\nIn reviewing nine inch nails' London show, Melody Maker stated, &quot;Pretty great\nmachine...there's no one who uses the word fuck quite like Trent Reznor...\nReznor is a law unto himself...Reznor has the mystique of a dark angel, a \npresence that permeates every awe-filled onlooker.&quot; In Milan, La Republica \nstated, &quot;hard, intense, visionary music...nine inch nails have literally driven\nto collective exaltation the people gathered at The Alcatraz in Milan...it was\nthe hardest and most fascinating rock show of the year.&quot;\n\nThe footage for the special has been culled from shows in Barcelona, Milan,\nMunich, Vienna, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Dusseldorf, Tilburg and London, \nand was shot by both fans - picked randomly from the crowd - and \nprofessional cameramen.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nThe MTV special was a way to document the first of I hope many legs of\nthe 'fragility' tour. The size of venues, the choice of music, the scale\nand approach to production of those shows will most likely not be reproduced\nEVER with the exception of possibly Japan. I was pleasantly surprised at \nthe reaction and felt the need to somehow fill everybody else in \non what happened. \n\nTechnical notes: all the video was filmed by friends and fans on \nconsumer level DV. The audio was mixed in a studio, but not 'fixed' or \nre-recorded as is so often so. \n\nWhat you see is close to what it was - close but not the same.\n\n-trent\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nThe Channel V footage aired on March 4th &amp; 5th, 2000 and were filmed at \nthe Big Day Out in Sydney, Australia. &quot;We know that some of the sets didn't go\nfor as long as y'all would have liked, but I'm afraid our hands were tied in \nthat instance. Some bands simply said 'No' to allowing us to \nfilm certain songs&quot;\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nThis release is available as a DVD image with uncompressed audio, deinterlaced\nMP4 files for each concert, 320kbps MP3s of each of the tracks, and two FLAC\nfiles of the audio, completely unprocessed, as ripped from the BetacamSP tapes.\nThere is no HD version of this footage, as it was shot on consumer-grade\ndigital video cameras.\n\nIf you like what you see and hear here, visit http://www.echoingthesound.org\n\nSpecial thanks to Bill Casanova Productions ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f7c5d5e2023d9fde87e62e60b919fa699bcce6","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Fragility+1.0+and+Big+Day+Out+2000+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71f7c5d5e2023d9fde87e62e60b919fa699bcce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,247,197,213,226,2,61,159,222,135,230,46,96,185,25,250,105,155,204,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
