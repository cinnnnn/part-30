Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap.&quot; --Michael J. Fox\n\nIn September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with ParkinsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disease -- a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for ParkinsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. \n\nMPEG-1 layer 3\n132 kbps (VBR), 5811 frames\n44100 Hz Joint Stereo\nListening time: 5 hours, 31 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49879f17dabc7ee7b795017eec14b4f0efda13cb","amp;dn":"Michael+J+Fox+-+Lucky+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49879f17dabc7ee7b795017eec14b4f0efda13cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,135,159,23,218,188,126,231,183,149,1,126,236,20,180,240,239,218,19,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
