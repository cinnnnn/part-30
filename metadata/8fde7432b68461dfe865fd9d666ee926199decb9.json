As a wide survey of\nfootwork, it's most easily compared to\nPlanet Mu's foundational Bangs &amp; Works\ncompilations, even though it lands on\nHyperdub. Those two scene-spanning\ndiscs, from 2010 and 2011, showed the\nworld footwork in its relative infancy.\nNext Life outlines the genre in its\ncosmopolitan, world-conquering\nadulthood. Overflowing with new talent\nand continuously gobbling up any\ninfluence it can find, footwork is no\nlonger a strictly regional\nphenomenonwhich is in part due to\nRashad Harden's prolific work as the\ngenre's de facto ambassador.\n\nWhen we first encountered footwork, it\nwas defined by rudimentary production\nvalues, a speed demon rush and trippy,\nfree-floating basslines. As it's\nmutated and intertwined with jungle,\ndrum &amp; bass, trap and grime, it's grown\ninto more of a feeling than a genre\nproper. Next Life stretches footwork\npast its breaking point several times\nover. Sirr Tmo's noir-ish &quot;Live In\nChicago Subways&quot; barely even sounds\nlike footwork, taking the genre's\nobsession with weed to its most\nparanoid, claustrophobic conclusions.\nEarl and Taye slip jungle breaks into\n&quot;Do This Again&quot; with the kind of\nprecision usually reserved for\nsurgical-grade drum &amp; bass, while Tre's\n&quot;DNB Spaceout&quot; reinforces its\nfoundation with fidgety, Fracture-style\ndrum layering.\n\nProduction values mark the biggest\ndifference between Teklife then and\nnow. Many of these tracks have velvety\ntones and lustrous textures. Even\nTraxman, famous for his crude cut-ups,\nseems inspired by the lusher side of\nChicago house on &quot;Sit Ya Self Down.&quot;\nThe core Teklife members, meanwhile,\ncontinue to grow more soulful and\nfunky. Rashad makes his only appearance\non the four-way collaboration &quot;OTS,&quot; a\npowerful tune that embodies footwork's\nsea change.\n\nBut the core crew's turn towards\npolished sounds is only one part of the\nfootwork story. There are plenty of\nno-nonsense, straight-for-the-jugular\ntunes, tooÃƒÂ¹DJ Manny's &quot;Harvey Rachet&quot;\npresents the genre at its most\nelemental, RP Boo's &quot;That's It 4 Lil\nMa&quot; is typically brash and Boylan's &quot;He\nWatchin Us&quot; feels almost like a legacy\ntrack, repeating the word &quot;ghettotech&quot;\nas if to remind us of footwork's roots.\n\nAll of this makes for a pretty jumbled\nlisten, especially when you throw in\nnearly-unrecognizable twists from the\nlikes of Durban and Heavee. There was a\nmoment when Teklife was associated with\njust a few core artists and one\nidentifiable style, but over time the\nstable has ballooned into something\nporous and open-ended, much in the same\nway the footwork scene has looked\nbeyond Chicago towards the rest of the\nworld. The sound is a fitting and\npowerful legacy for one of dance\nmusic's brightest minds to leave behind\nin his wake.\n\npsst, more info at hyperdub.net\n\n01     Dj Spinn x Taso - Burn That Kush                     03:38\n02     Dj Earl x Dj Taye - Do This Again                    04:07\n03     Dj Taye x Dj Manny - The Matrixx                     03:13\n04     Dj Phil - Godz House                                 04:01\n05     Dj Tre - Dnb Spaceout                                03:15\n06     Traxman - Sit Ya Self Down                           03:59\n07     Sirr Tmo - Live In Chicago Subway                    04:49\n08     Rp Boo - That's It 4 Lil Ma                          03:13\n09     Gant - Man-Jungle Juke                               03:42\n10     Dj Manny - Harvey Ratchet                            03:18\n11     Boylan - He Watching Us                              04:38\n12     Dj Paypal - Fm Blast                                 03:18\n13     Dj Earl x Dj Taye - Wurkinn Da Bass                  02:49\n14     Dj Rashad - OTS                                      04:26\n15     Heavee - 8 Bit Shit                                  04:38\n16     Tripletrain - Never Could Be Pt.2                    03:21\n17     Durban - I'm So                                      03:13\n18     Taso - Drop That Thang                               02:52\n19     Dj Chap - Glacier Bae                                04:28\n20     Dj Paypal x Feloneezy x Jackie Dagger - U Should No  03:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fde7432b68461dfe865fd9d666ee926199decb9","amp;dn":"VA-Next_Life-%28HDBCD029%29-CD-2014-jAZzMan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fde7432b68461dfe865fd9d666ee926199decb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,222,116,50,182,132,97,223,232,101,253,157,102,110,233,38,25,157,236,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
