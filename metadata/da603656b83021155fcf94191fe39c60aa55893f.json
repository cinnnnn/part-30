Get out of Congress, loser! Go to CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â€where people like you belong! Of course Trey Radel also voted to require food stamp recipients to be drug tested, so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hypocrite on top of everything. But then you guessed that when you heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“GOP CongressmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“cocaine possession.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ By the way, in the places like Florida where they do drug test food stamp recipients, hardly anyone turns out to be using drugs. I guess thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because not a lot of GOP Congressmen are applying for food stamps. Oh, Radel was also fined $250. For buying 3.5 grams of cocaine? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry, but shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the fine be more than what the person was actually willing to spend on the drugs? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not in the cocaine marketplace, but I think that 3.5 grams of coke costs more than $250. Getting busted actually saved Trey Radel money!\n\nGeorge Zimmerman is free on bail. That announcement should be made from loudspeaker trucks all over Florida, for public safety. One of the conditions the judge set for the bail is that Zimmerman cannot have any guns or ammunition. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that cruel and unusual punishment? How is supposed to be able to breathe?\n\nOn CNN, Erin Burnett pressured Rand Paul to admit that Obamacare was a success in Kentucky. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way Rand Paul could deny it and still tell the truth, so he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ tell the truth, that is. Paul claimed that the number of people Ã¢â‚¬Å“being cancelled dwarfs the number actually signing up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ What he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mentioned is that the people being cancelled are getting better and cheaper plans. Saying that people in Kentucky are having their insurance cancelled is like saying that people who find jobs are being denied unemployment! TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting something better, Rand! But then he knows thatÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why he lied about it.\n\nThe rightwing media claims that President Obama intentionally left out the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“under GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from a recitation he did of the Gettysburg Address. Rush Limbaugh said that Obama just did it Ã¢â‚¬Å“to get a rise out of conservatives,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ adding Ã¢â‚¬Å“It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a rise out of me, because I understand exactly whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Well, nothing gets a rise out of you, RushÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what the Viagra is for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da603656b83021155fcf94191fe39c60aa55893f","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+20+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da603656b83021155fcf94191fe39c60aa55893f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,96,54,86,184,48,33,21,95,207,148,25,31,227,156,96,170,85,137,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
