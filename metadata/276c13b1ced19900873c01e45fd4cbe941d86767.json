Perennial Favorites covers a lot of ground: aching balladry (&quot;Low Down Man,&quot; complete with pedal steel and intoned lovingly by chanteuse Katharine Whalen), hilarious show-tune homages (&quot;Ghost of Stephen Foster&quot;), romping props to the past (&quot;Pallin&amp;#039; with Al,&quot; a nod to guitarist Al Casey). Thanks to imaginative arrangements, &quot;The Kraken&quot; and &quot;My Drag&quot; transcend retro hipness to forge unique sonic paths. &quot;Suits Are Picking Up the Bill,&quot; a zingy diatribe on capitalism, may not turn out to be a smash hit like the earlier &quot;Hell,&quot; but these Favorites should endure.\n\n\nPreview:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000009PNN/ref=s9_asin_image_1/103-6146498-5428665&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000009PNN/ref=s9_asin_image_1/103-6146498-5428665&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276c13b1ced19900873c01e45fd4cbe941d86767","amp;dn":"Squirrel+Nut+Zippers+-+Perennial+Favorites+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276c13b1ced19900873c01e45fd4cbe941d86767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,108,19,177,206,209,153,0,135,60,1,228,95,212,203,233,65,216,103,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
