Hearn got a job working for the government through a local agency.  But things were not as great as they seemedÃ¢â‚¬â€several months into his tenure, Hearn became aware of some Ã¢â‚¬Å“questionable activityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ involving several direct co-workers within his own department.  Ignoring the pleas of those close to him to just Ã¢â‚¬Å“let it goÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Hearn brought his concerns up to his supervisorsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and almost immediately became the target of smear campaigns and retaliatory attacks designed to force him out of his job.\n\nEventually, the plan worked.  But Hearn was not going to go quietly.  Disillusioned and infuriated, he enlisted the help of two friends, and started Leadsucker as a means to cope with his intense rage.\n\nThe end result throws subtlety out the windowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦LeadsuckerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“BurnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a fierce, unrelenting hardcore punk album that takes no prisoners as it chews through 30 tracks in under 26 minutes.  The failures of American politics are at the forefront, and nothing is off limits:  Politicians are called out by name, government secrets are exposed, and taboo subjects are treated with all the tenderness of a piranha attack.  \n\nThis is punk the way it was meant to be: abrasive, corrosive, and confrontational.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that rare work that obliterates party lines to deliver a single, unified message:  That the real battle isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t between Democrats and Republicans, but rather citizens and their own government.\n\n1.)
