One morning, a busy London market is decimated by an explosion. In the manhunt that follows, only one member of the suspected terrorist cell survives: Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto), who is arrested and jailed. Preparations begin for what promises to be the trial of the century. But there's a hitch: the government will use classified evidence to prosecute Erdogan, evidence so secret that neither he nor his lawyers can be allowed to see it. Hence the need for the Attorney General (Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent) to appoint a Special Advocate, an additional government-approved defense lawyer (Claudia Simmons-Howe, played by Golden Globe Award nominee Rebecca Hall), one who has clearance to see classified evidence and who can argue for its full disclosure when the trial moves to &quot;closed&quot; session. The rules for the Special Advocate are clear: once the secret evidence is shared with her, Claudia will not be allowed to communicate even with the defendant or with\nother members of the defense team. But just as the case is on the eve of going to trial, Erdogan's lawyer dies suddenly, and a new defense attorney, Martin Rose (Eric Bana), quickly steps in. Martin is tenacious, driven, and brilliant - and an ex-lover of Claudia's. The two lawyers make an uncomfortable pact to keep their former affair hidden. But as Martin begins to piece the case together, the outlines of a sinister conspiracy emerge, one that will draw him and Claudia dangerously close again.\n\n\n***********************\n\n- Duration: 1h 35mn\n\n- Bit rate: 918 Kbps\n\n- Res: 720 x 296\n\n- AR: 2.40:1\n\n- FPS: 23.976\n\n- Audio: AC3, 128kbps\n\n************************\n\n\nGeneral\n------------\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 724 MiB\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate : 1055 Kbps\nWriting library : VirtualDub build 35491\n\nVideo\n--------------\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate : 918 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 296 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.40:1\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.180\nStream size : 630 MiB (87%)\nWriting library : XviD 65\n\nAudio\n-------------\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 87.8 MiB (12%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 512 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2026bf55f73d791d6256c476bfbd164b1955bcf1","amp;dn":"Closed+Circuit+2013+HDRip+XviD+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2026bf55f73d791d6256c476bfbd164b1955bcf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,38,191,85,247,61,121,29,98,86,196,118,191,189,22,75,25,85,188,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
