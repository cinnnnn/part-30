From the in-your-face shredding opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Uphill Battle,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the self-titled, powerful closer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Won't Hold This Against You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this Cleveland-based group has written a record for pop punk lovers old and new.\n\n  * That's right, I Won't Hold This Against You is the type of pop punk fans have grown to love over the years. It is honest, transparent and blasting. The record contains songs that hold the tone and attitude of an early-mid 2000's pop punk act, while still stirring elements around enough to stay relevant in 2013. For example, the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeadlinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ explodes with a passive aggressive nature that can easily fall into comparison to an early number from the days of The JV Allstars. Diversity is also shown on I Won't Hold This Against You, with the standout number, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hindsight.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18dd76791fe445c48af6cd888e9de892196418ee","amp;dn":"Light+Years+-+I+Won%27t+Hold+This+Against+You+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18dd76791fe445c48af6cd888e9de892196418ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,221,118,121,31,228,69,196,138,246,205,136,142,157,232,146,25,100,24,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
