Vines for Wines will expand the wine loverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge and appreciation of a great range of wines and help to explore their individual preferences for specific varieties, blends, flavours and styles.\n\nThis book is based on the highly successful Wine Grape Varieties, which is an aid to identifying grape vines. Vines for Wines, however, focuses on wines from the average consumerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point-of-view, introducing the different wine grape varieties and the wines made from them, including blends. Each variety is represented by a colour photograph of the grape variety, its current world plantings, wine produced and notes describing the varietal characters for each wine grape variety.\n\nThe tasting terms and wine notes for each variety provide a benchmark for the consumer to assess the quality of wines they drink, and to allow them to share and compare their experiences confidently with other wine lovers.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Easy to read and assumes no in-depth knowledge\n* Explains tasting terminology and wine styles\n* High quality colour photographs\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 96 pages\n    * Publisher: CSIRO Publishing (October 1, 2004)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0643090665\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0643090668","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d913318e8cda9bf3c444c5100e47062d49ee7644","amp;dn":"Vines+for+Wines%3A+A+Wine+Lover%5C%27s+Guide+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d913318e8cda9bf3c444c5100e47062d49ee7644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,19,49,142,140,218,155,243,196,68,197,16,14,71,6,45,73,238,118,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
