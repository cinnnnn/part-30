We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.\n\nIn Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it controls almost every piece of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technology and holds key information on all of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residents.\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and more.\n\nUse the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.\nKEY FEATURES\nHACK THE CITY\nWatch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CTOS can become your weapon.\n\nSTREET JUSTICE\nLiving in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation. The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.\n\nHIGH OCTANE DRIVING\nUbisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.\n\nEVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL\nDisrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.\n\nDYNAMIC NAVIGATION\nWatch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.\n\nSEAMLESS MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE\nDiscover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED WITH A NEW WAY TO PLAY\nTake your experience beyond the console with a groundbreaking, real-time, companion game. This innovative mobile platform allows players to connect and compete with friends, even when away from their home console. The Watch_Dogs companion game delivers revolutionary dual-screen gameplay that enables you to play from anywhere, at any time.\nSystem Requirements\n\n    Minimum:\n        OS: Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1) or Windows 8 (Please note that we only support 64 bit OSs.)\n        Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400 @ 2.66Ghz or AMD Phenom II X4 940 @ 3.0Ghz\n        Memory: 6 GB RAM\n        Graphics: DirectX 11 graphics card with 1 GB Video RAM - Nvidia Geforce GTX 460 or AMD Radeon HD 5770\n        DirectX: Version 11\n        Hard Drive: 25 GB available space\n        Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card with Latest Drivers\n        Additional Notes: Broadband connection and service required for multiplayer mode.
