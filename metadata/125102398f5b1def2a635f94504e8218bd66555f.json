Meet the master musicians who developed the wide range of sounds and moods that are so typical of this fascinating musical instrument.\n(liner notes)\n\nGreat collection of some classic recordings not heard in many years. Some recordings are obscure, others are remembered fondly. It's so nice that someone has taken the time and effort to rescure these old recordings so that a new generation of listeners can hear what real music sounds like in a world of mostly noisy racket we are constantly subjected to in today's world. Steel guitar remains the mystic instrument with a haunting sound unequaled by any instrument, and is sadly absent from today's music scene. A top-notch collection of some really great old songs and sounds!\n(Ray Aubrey, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Steelin It- the Steel Guitar Story 1925-1957\n(4CD United States Dist 2008)\n\nCD1 Slidin' on the Frets\nCD2 Steel Guitar Stomp\nCD3 Steeling the Blues\nCD4 Steeling the Mood\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125102398f5b1def2a635f94504e8218bd66555f","amp;dn":"VA+-+Steelin%27+It-+The+Steel+Guitar+Story+-+4CD-BOX+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125102398f5b1def2a635f94504e8218bd66555f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,81,2,57,143,91,29,239,42,99,95,148,80,78,130,24,189,102,85,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
