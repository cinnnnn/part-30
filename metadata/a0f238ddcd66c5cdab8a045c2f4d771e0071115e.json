The lemurs care for this egg and the young creature born from it, which they call Aladar. When a meteor shower hits earth, Aladar and his family must leave their homeland. Away from home and as close to danger as they have ever been, they meet up with a huge group of dinosaurs, led by Kron and Bruton. All together they are trying to reach the nesting grounds, but it's not going to be easy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0f238ddcd66c5cdab8a045c2f4d771e0071115e","amp;dn":"Dinosaur+-+Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0f238ddcd66c5cdab8a045c2f4d771e0071115e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,242,56,221,205,102,197,205,171,138,4,92,47,77,119,30,0,113,17,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
