The DEA raid on the Wo/MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alliance for Medical Marijuana, a sanctuary for severely ill patients who were using marijuana as medicine, is the riveting opening scene in Weed Land, an up-close journalistic narrative that chronicles a transformative epoch for marijuana in America.\n\nFrom the 1996 passage of CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Proposition 215, the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first medical marijuana law, through law enforcement raids, clinical studies that revealed medical benefits for cannabis, and the emergence of a lucrative cannabis industry, Weed Land reveals the changing political, legal, economic, and social dynamics around pot. Peter Hecht, an award-winning journalist from The Sacramento Bee, offers an independent, meticulously reported account of the clashes and contradictions of a burgeoning California cannabis culture that stoked pot liberalization across the country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce528dbdd110876dc6ed595a1025bae78d765d8e","amp;dn":"Weed+Land+Inside+America%27s+Marijuana+Epicenter+and+How+Pot+Went+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce528dbdd110876dc6ed595a1025bae78d765d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,82,141,189,209,16,135,109,198,237,89,90,16,37,186,231,141,118,93,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
