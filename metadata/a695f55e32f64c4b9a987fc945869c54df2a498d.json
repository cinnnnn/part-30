Recent college graduate Jim Chee has just taken a job with the Navajo Nation Police Dept. in Arizona, where he helps keep the peace with his superior Joe Leaphorn on land earmarked for joint use by Navajo and Hopi tribes. Cowboy Dashee, a sheriff from the Hopi law enforcement group, discovers a decaying and unidentified body in the desert, an event he thinks may be linked to a recent robbery at the reservation\\\\\\&amp;#039;s trading post. The shop\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Hopi manager, Jake West, is convinced that Joe Musket, a Navajo drug dealer and ne\\\\\\&amp;#039;er-do-well, is responsible, and as Chee and Leaphorn investigate the murder, the robbery, and a mysterious plane crash, they find themselves drawn into a world of mystery filled with drug dealers, F.B.I. agents, skinwalker witchcraft, intertribal politics and revenge. Dark Wind was based on a novel by noted crime author Tony Hillerman.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101664/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101664/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStarring\nLou Diamond Phillips........Officer Jim Chee\nFred Ward...................Lt.
