It's classic UFC tournament style with no weight classes ;)\n\nThe first round fights are:\n\nGerry Harris vs Paul Varelans\nMark Hall vs Harold Howard\nRemco Pardoel vs Ryan Parker\nMarco Ruas vs Larry Cureton\n\nThe winners go on to fight eachother until one remains. I won't give anything away except to say that this is one of the best UFC tournaments I've seen.\n\nThe superfight is: Ken Shamrock vs UFC 6 tournament winner Oleg Taktarov.\n\nI wanted to give something back to you Pirate Bay guys who I got ufc 1-6 from.\n\nHope you enjoy this as much as I did.\n\nPS I've only got 16 kb upload.  Please help me seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92960df168e267352ba72bc7c99599bb3c5a6352","amp;dn":"UFC+-+Ultimate+Fighting+Championship+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92960df168e267352ba72bc7c99599bb3c5a6352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,150,13,241,104,226,103,53,43,167,43,199,201,149,153,187,60,90,99,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
