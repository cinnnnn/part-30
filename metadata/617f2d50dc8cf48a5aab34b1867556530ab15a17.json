Farroukh Erdogan is detained as the primary suspect and mastermind of the attack while his two alleged co-conspirators are killed in attempts to apprehend them (unseen to the viewer).\n\nLawyers Martin Rose and Claudia Simmons-Howe are selected by the British Attorney General to represent Farroukh in court after the previous lawyer fell off a roof. The two lawyers secretly had an affair in the past, which became known to Martin's wife and has caused an alienation from her and their son. Due to the classified nature of the sources in the trial, the trial is split into two divisions. Claudia will represent Farroukh in closed hearings to attempt to determine which classified pieces of information are required for his defense. Martin will represent him in the open trial using information allowed by the closed hearings. The two lawyers are not allowed to contact one another. Claudia is watched over by MI5 agent Nazrul Sharma with very strict rules of accessing the classified information. Martin is assisted by friend and lawyer Devlin.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:617f2d50dc8cf48a5aab34b1867556530ab15a17","amp;dn":"The+Closed+Circuit+WebRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"617f2d50dc8cf48a5aab34b1867556530ab15a17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,127,45,80,220,140,244,138,90,171,52,177,134,117,86,83,10,177,90,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
