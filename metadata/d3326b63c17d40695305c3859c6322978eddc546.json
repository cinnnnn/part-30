Before he knows it, Jason Fury, Jedediah's son, is leading the wagons into Arizona Territory. There, the squabbling settlers decide to stop for good and start a town they'll name Fury, in honor of Jedediah. Marauding Indians coupled with harsh country will see to it that these settlers have a hardscrabble life. All Jason Fury ever wanted was to head back East where he has a shot at a decent life, but now he finds himself tied to the settlers. He can't leave these defenseless pioneers to be slaughtered among them, a pretty young lady that he's taken a shine to.
