However, it would be foolish to overlook &quot;A Christmas To Remember&quot;. an album that never disappoints. A beautiful and ecclectic collection of holiday songs, A Christmas To Remember can satisfy, to steal a line from Nat King Cole, &quot;Kids from one to ninety-two.&quot; From Pamela's magical renditions of &quot;Up On The Housetop&quot; and &quot;Frosty The Snowman&quot; to Max Kim's contributions on &quot;Dancin' In A Winter Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Rock Around The Christmas Tree&quot;, these Christmas recordings truly warm the soul. The Swingin' Organs' whimsical &quot;Christmas Polka&quot; is an instant classic, and Atlanta Rhythm's &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; is a delightful twist on the Bobby Helms classic. For a fitting ending, The Christmas Brass's take on &quot;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&quot; only leaves you wanting more. \n\nThis album is a must-own for anyone who appreciates good holiday music, and the bountiful 25-track songlist makes it a bargain. Our family has this album on constant rotation during the holidays, and I highly recommend that you do the same.
