Nanami &quot;saves&quot; Mikage from a dog and tells him her story. He gives Nanami his house as a thank you for saving him. Nanami accepts the offer, due to having nowhere else to go. Mikage draws her up a map showing her where to go. Upon arriving, she finds that it is a rundown shrine. Nanami is then almost killed by Tomoe, who was expecting Mikage to finally return after his 20 year absence. She is then greeted by both Onikiri and Kotetsu, as the new land god of the shrine. Unable to accept Nanami as the new land god, Tomoe mocks her then leaves the shrine, which, without Tomoe's power transforms back into a run-down state. Not wanting to rob Tomoe of his home and realizing that her powers as a god are too weak anyway Nanami leaves, but eventually is brought back by Tomoe after she seals a contract with him, making him her familiar.\n\n\n\nRelease date : January 6, 2013\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\n\nGenres: comedy, romance, supernatural","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce9dfdce0361d2f2488d4372d582da1896bc3eb","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Kamisama+Kiss+-+13+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce9dfdce0361d2f2488d4372d582da1896bc3eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,233,223,220,224,54,29,47,36,136,212,55,45,88,45,161,137,107,195,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
