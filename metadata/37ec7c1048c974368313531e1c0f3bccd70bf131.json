Red Tide introduces a new\nstory driven campaign  based  on  the  writings  of\nSoviet scribe Alexander Zorich,  it  also  includes\ndozens of new or upgraded units and weapons. Men of\nWar: Red Tide is a stunning mixture of  RTS  and  a\nthird-person action that introduces a new  fighting\nforce known for its brutal  efficiency  during  the\nheight of World War II. Played out across more than\n20 missions, Men of War: Red Tide  allows  to  take\ncommand of the feared &quot;Black Coats,&quot;  the  nickname\ngiven to Soviet  Marines,  an  elite  combat  group\nspecializing in engagements near the shoreline. The\nplayer  has  direct  control  of  new  game   units\nincluding the Black  Coats,  tanks,  self-propelled\nguns, armored trains, landing craft, artillery  and\nnew enemy emplaced weapons to capture and use.  New\nair  support  options  include  fighters,  bombers,\nhydroplanes; cruisers,  destroyers  and  gun  boats\nwhich provide naval fire support.  Fighting  during\nthe Black Sea Campaigns of WWII, history buffs  and\nWWII aficionados will recognize theaters of  battle\nsuch as Odessa,  Sevastopol,  Theodosia,  Eltingen,\nNikolaev and Constanta.\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nREADNFO:\nThe ADDONiA is not valid and  should  be  nuked  as\nit's way oversized. Not because we can make smaller\nrelease  using  compression,  but   because   their\nrelease is about  1GB  bigger  than  all  gamefiles\ncombined. Game on Steam  is  2.06GB,  all  language\nfiles  put  together  are  2.01GB  (sizes  can   be\nverified even on steamdb webpage). So max size  for\nthis release should be 4.07GB  and  thats  with  no\ncompression used. So why is ADDONiA release 4.94GB?\nWe are not sure, but they probably  fucked  up  the\nmultilanguage part of installer and put dupe  files\ninside. This is an older game and it gets  uploaded\nonly to sites with games  archive,  so  care  about\nthoes archives and do not make  oversized  releases\nwith dupe data inside! Ou  release is over 1GB (iso\nsize is 4.94GB vs 3.90GB) smaller than ADDONiA with\n2 additional languages included (fits  to  a  DVD5,\nlike it should). Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ec7c1048c974368313531e1c0f3bccd70bf131","amp;dn":"Men+of+War+Red+Tide+MULTi8+READNFO-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ec7c1048c974368313531e1c0f3bccd70bf131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,236,124,16,72,201,116,54,131,19,83,30,28,15,59,204,215,11,241,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
