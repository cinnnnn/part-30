The primary purpose of overlays is to extend the life of the candidate structures, either by restoring the quality and integrity of the surface and/or the re-establishing or improving the load-carrying capacity. Nevertheless, the durability of bonded overlay systems still draws concerns in the technical community because of bond sustainability problems encountered in a number of cases. At this time, there is still no accepted design approach or methodology that can warrant the practitioner a successful outcome of the repair. This State-of-Art report summarizes the findings with respect to all aspects involved in the overlaying process.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 198 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (April 6, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9400712383\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9400712386","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e57bc37c6ea0ed26896755cde40f089d35dd48a","amp;dn":"Bonded+Cement%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e57bc37c6ea0ed26896755cde40f089d35dd48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,87,188,55,198,234,14,210,104,150,117,92,222,64,240,137,211,93,212,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
