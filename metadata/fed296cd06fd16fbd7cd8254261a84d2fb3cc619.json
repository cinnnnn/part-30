Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. ...\n\nRead all of the bio at: http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nA reissue that combines 1967's Another Side of Rick and 1969's Perspective onto one CD. By 1967, Nelson's records were no longer selling, and were out of step with contemporary trends. So, why not, someone must have reasoned, try to put Nelson in step with contemporary trends on Another Side of Rick? It was about as good a strategy as any, considering that his tried-and-true rockaballad format wasn't working. But giving him fruity psychedelic baroque production was not the answer, indeed yielding rather embarrassing results. Nelson showed good taste by covering three Tim Hardin songs, but producer John Boylan's five songs not only weren't that good, but weren't a good match for the vocalist. ...\n\nRead all of the review here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/another-side-of-rickperspective-r377448/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/another-side-of-rickperspective-r377448/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========\n\nAnother Side Of Rick\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nBy 1967 Nelson's records were no longer selling, and out of step with contemporary trends.

Like his previous Another Side of Rick, this had him making ill-advised efforts to modernize his sound with a more orchestrated production, whose nature sometimes often verged on the rococo. Nelson did have good taste in selecting material, covering songs by Paul Simon, Richie Havens, Harry Nilsson, and Randy Newman, all of whom (except Simon) were little known by most of the public in 1967; indeed, Nelson covers five Newman songs in a row to end the album, creating the effect of an aborted Nelson Sings Newman concept record. Producer John Boylan added most of the remaining tunes, including the odd &quot;Hello to the Wind (Bonjour Le Vent)&quot; (co-written with Nelson), which with its Burt Bacharach-type piano-based melody and brief interlude of spoken female French narration might find a comfortable home on some lounge music reissue. The LP has been reissued, together with 1967's Another Side of Rick, on an Ace CD that combines both albums onto one disc.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/perspective-r13817&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/perspective-r13817&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000AGCA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000AGCA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
