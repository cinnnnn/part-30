Julio (Diego Noguera) was an aspiring writer attending college in the town of Valdivia, Chile. While Julio had an interest in literature, he was a lackadaisical student, and when asked in class if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d read Marcel Proust, he said yes even though it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t true. Julio told the same lie to his beautiful classmate Emilia (Natalia Galgani), and the two fell into a relationship that was destined to end badly. Years later, Emilia is out of JulioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living in Santiago while trying to pursue a career as a novelist. Julio is dating Blanca (Trinidad Gonzalez), a neighbor who shares his interest in the written word, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the running for a job helping well-respected author Gazmuri (Hugo Medina) transcribe his hand-written rough drafts into printed manuscripts on his computer. Julio is passed over for the project, but rather than tell Blanca the truth, he begins writing his own version of GazmuriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel as a cover, with the story inspired by his failed romance with Emilia. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB Rating: 6.1/10 from 211 users \nDirected by: CristiÃƒÂ¡n JimÃƒÂ©nez \nStarring: Diego Noguera, Nathalia Galgani and Gabriela Arancibia \n\nRelease Name: Bonsai.2011.LiMiTED.SUBBED.DVDRip.XviD-LPD \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 880 kb/s \nAudio: Spanish, MP3, 128 kb/s \nRuntime: 1h 36mn \nSubtitles: English Hardcoded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b2b4ecdc6604288377ce1e811567584a766fdf","amp;dn":"Bonsai+2011+LiMiTED+SUBBED+DVDRip+XviD-LPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b2b4ecdc6604288377ce1e811567584a766fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,178,180,236,220,102,4,40,131,119,206,30,129,21,103,88,74,118,111,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
