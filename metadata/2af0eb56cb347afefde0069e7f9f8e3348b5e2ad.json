I knew the musical feel I wanted but could not find it until 1993 when I first heard The Bushbury Mountain Daredevils - a Birmingham band who played just what I heard in my head. So here it is, a Brummie album from top to toe. And I know what the 'Man who is Brum' thinks about as he stands there, the master of fire and stars. I know the lonely dreams that light his vigil, for I heard him empty his heart.&quot; \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af0eb56cb347afefde0069e7f9f8e3348b5e2ad","amp;dn":"Harvey+Andrews...Snaps%281995%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af0eb56cb347afefde0069e7f9f8e3348b5e2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,240,235,86,203,52,122,254,253,224,6,158,127,159,142,51,72,181,226,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
