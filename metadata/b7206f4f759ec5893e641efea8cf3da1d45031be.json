ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a PvP instance where every new player that joins it will be placed in one of two warring factions. All players will start with the ability to establish new towns, so building new towns at first is recommended. The first team to capture all enemy towns wins. Battlegrounds have a fixed 20 minute duration. If no faction succeeds in driving out the competition, the faction with the most towns at the end of the 20 minute mark will win the match.\nFriendly NPCs that spawn will now mostly match the tier of pirates. So if a region youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in commonly spawns Pirate Captains, you can expect to be sailing with friendly Lieutenants. This should make soloing easier and your friendly AI ships lessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ sucky.\nPvP challenges will now end if one faction captures all towns in the region and defeats all enemy AI ships.\nReputation awards will now be appropriately adjusted to the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s level.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now possible to dock in towns in regions higher level than the player, but the player still wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to do any quests, buy items or trade cargo there.\nTop 3 players on the scoreboard when the pirates get driven out of an instance or battleground contest ends will now get an extra reward. Note that this requires a minimum of 2-3 players (depending on level), and the quality of the rewards go up with the number of players present.\nAI ships should no longer get hurt by friendly ramming damage.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no longer possible to place structures while flying.\nAir ships can now fly in low level regions, unless PvP is on.\n2 followers is no longer hard-coded to faction 6 (Aequitas). You can now specify Ã¢â‚¬Å“followers = #Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a part of the factionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data in the configuration file, where # is 0, 1 or 2.\n\n\n== Instructions: \nStart the update and select your game folder to update.\n\n\n\n OTHER/INFO\n LuKeStorm\n=============\n\nAbout the Update\n Created from a clean and verified Steam installation.\n \n =====================================================================\n Greets: All who make quality work out of conviction!\n =====================================================================\n\n\n\n            If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding!\n                  Support game development and buy the game!\n\n\nGame made by \nTasharen Entertainment Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7206f4f759ec5893e641efea8cf3da1d45031be","amp;dn":"Windward+%28Cumulative+Update+to+v2015-06-05.0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7206f4f759ec5893e641efea8cf3da1d45031be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,32,111,79,117,158,197,137,62,100,30,254,168,207,61,161,212,80,49,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
