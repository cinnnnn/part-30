There she discovers a stone chest inscribed with a stunning claim: inside lie the bones of none other than Jesus of Nazareth. Faced with a case of unimaginable proportions, Miranda summons Brockton for help proving or refuting the claim. Both scientists are skepticalÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, fake relics abounded during the Middle AgesÃ¢â‚¬â€but evidence for authenticity looks strong initially, and soon grows stronger.\n\nBrockton and Miranda link the bones to the haunting image on the Shroud of Turin, revered by millions as the burial cloth of Christ, and then a laboratory test finds the bones to be two thousand years old. The finding triggers a deadly tug-of-war between the anthropologists, the Vatican, and a deadly zealot who hopes to use the bones to bring about the Second ComingÃ¢â‚¬â€and trigger the end of time.\n\nSet against an international landscape, and weaving a rich tapestry of religion, history, art, and science, The Inquisitor's Key takes Jefferson Bass to an exciting new level of suspense.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9561c07072968eb6048f775ee2b7f621693360","amp;dn":"The+Inquisitor%27s+Key+-+Jefferson+Bass+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9561c07072968eb6048f775ee2b7f621693360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,149,97,192,112,114,150,142,182,4,143,119,94,226,183,246,33,105,51,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
