Queen KuntiÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s celebrated prayers consist of only twenty-six couplets, yet they are considered a philosophical, theological, and literary masterpiece. The book includes those inspired verses and illuminating commentary by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and the most renowned Vedic scholar and spiritual leader of our time.\n\nThe tragic and heroic figure of Queen KuntÃ„Â« emerges from an explosive era in the history of ancient India. As related in the MahÃ„ï¿½bhÃ„ï¿½rata, India's grand epic poem of 110,000 couplets, KuntÃ„Â« was the wife of King PÃ„ï¿½nÃŒÂ£dÃŒÂ£u and the mother of five illustrious sons known as the PÃ„ï¿½nÃŒÂ£dÃŒÂ£avas. As such, she was one of the central figures in a complex political drama that culminated fifty centuries ago in the KuruksÃŒÂ£etra War, a devastating war of ascendancy that changed the course of world events.\n\nKuntÃ„Â«'s spontaneous glorification of Lord KrÃŒÂ£sÃŒÂ£nÃŒÂ£a and her description of the spiritual path are immortalized in the MahÃ„ï¿½bhÃ„ï¿½rata and the BhÃ„ï¿½gavata PurÃ„ï¿½nÃŒÂ£a (Ã…Å¡rÃ„Â«mad-BhÃ„ï¿½gavatam), and they have been recited, chanted, and sung by sages and philosophers for thousands of years.\n\n\nKunti says in Ã…Å¡rÃ„Â«mad-BhÃ„ï¿½gavatam 1.8.42:\nO Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else.\n\n\nKunti says in Ã…Å¡rÃ„Â«mad-BhÃ„ï¿½gavatam 1.8.25:\nI wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0f94b92a2821664713445208369dbf245197d4","amp;dn":"Teachings+of+Queen+Kunti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0f94b92a2821664713445208369dbf245197d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,15,148,185,42,40,33,102,71,19,68,82,8,54,157,191,36,81,151,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
