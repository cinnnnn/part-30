He also wrote a great deal of chamber and sacred music. Rubbra's works went into eclipse in the 60s and 70s, as the BBC management pushed British serialists to garner musical attention abroad, but he lived long enough to see the critical tide reverse itself, and respect return for at least some of his life's work.\r\n\r\nHis Ninth Symphony was unusually a choral one, and also depicted the Christian Resurrection--but not in triumphalist terms. Instead, Rubbra focuses until the last bars on searing spiritual and physical pain. It is regarded as one of the major choral works of the 20th century; and the composer's final wish on his deathbed was that someday it be recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.\r\n\r\nYou can find my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af753e6c78dd478ba3aec17cf9e62d2098eed20","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%239+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%281993%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af753e6c78dd478ba3aec17cf9e62d2098eed20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,247,83,230,199,141,212,120,186,58,236,23,207,158,98,210,9,142,237,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
