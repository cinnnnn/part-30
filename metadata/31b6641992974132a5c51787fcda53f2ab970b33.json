Big business and the FDA have fostered that dangerous misconception. The truth is Splenda is by no means safe; and the same is true for many of the other artificial sweeteners being marketed today. Dr. Joseph Mercola---supported by extensive studies and research---exposes the fact that Splenda actually contributes to a host of serious diseases. Sweet Deception will lay out how the FDA really works for big food companies and should not be trusted when it comes to your health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b6641992974132a5c51787fcda53f2ab970b33","amp;dn":"Sweet+Deception+by+Dr.+Mercola+and+Dr.+Pearsall+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b6641992974132a5c51787fcda53f2ab970b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,182,100,25,146,151,65,50,165,197,23,135,252,218,83,242,171,151,11,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
