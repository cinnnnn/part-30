The song is included on a re-issue of Chesney's Greatest Hits II. The song will also be heard in the end credits to Chesney's upcoming film Summer in 3D.\n\nOn the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of February 27, 2010, the song debuted at #23. On the Canadian Radio &amp; Records Country Singles charts for the week of March 7, 2010, the song debuted at #39.

On the Canadian Hot 100 charts for the week of April 9, 2010, the song debuted at #88.\n\nGreatest Hits II is a compilation album by country music artist Kenny Chesney. It was released on May 19, 2009, and it is his second greatest hits album since Greatest Hits in 2000. The album includes twelve singles from 2002 to 2009, as well as two non-singles from previous albums (&quot;Be as You Are&quot; from Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair) and &quot;I'm Alive&quot; from Lucky Old Sun). Also included is the new song &quot;Out Last Night&quot;, which was issued as a single in March 2009, followed by &quot;I'm Alive&quot; in August 2009.\n\nThe album will be re-released in 2010 to include two new tracks, &quot;This Is Our Moment&quot; and &quot;Ain't Back Yet&quot;. The former was used by the television network ESPN as a college football theme and peaked at #46 based on unsolicited airplay, while the latter was released to radio in February 2010.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for Allmusic, gave it four stars out of five. He said that the album was stronger than his last two studio albums because it did not contain as many laid-back songs. Erlewine also called &quot;Out Last Night&quot; an &quot;amiable day-after shuffle.&quot;\n\nKenneth Arnold &quot;Kenny&quot; Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country music artist.
