At their best, Roxy combine these two extremes, like on the exhilarating opener &quot;The Thrill of It All,&quot; but Country Life benefits considerably from the ebb and flow of the group's two extremes, since it showcases their deft instrumental execution and their textured, enthralling songwriting. And, in many ways, Country Life offers the greatest and most consistent set of Roxy Music songs, illustrating their startling depth. From the sleek rock of &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; and &quot;Prairie Rose&quot; to the elegant, string-laced pop of &quot;A Really Good Time,&quot; Country Life is filled with thrilling songs, and Roxy Music rarely sounded as invigorating as they do here. \n\n\n\n   1.
