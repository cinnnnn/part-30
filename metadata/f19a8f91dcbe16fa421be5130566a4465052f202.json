Families have gathered in the sullen isolation to enjoy the lazy summer days. Carmine, the oldest camper in the group, leads this year&amp;#039;s adventure into the woods. A group of teens follow. This summer is not the same as the last as the group decides to cross the forbidden river that leads off camp property. Joe, the local among the group, is determined to make a prank of the outing and take the vulnerable city kids to the infamous Cappy&amp;#039;s cabin. Cappy, a campfire tale of a backwoods hunter is more than legend. The children come upon a clearing in the woods. It is the cabin. Joe peers in through a dirty window, nothing. He looks further into the deepness of the dark room. A dead girl lies outstretched on the floor as Clem, one of Cappy&amp;#039;s sons cries over her body. The chase begins.
