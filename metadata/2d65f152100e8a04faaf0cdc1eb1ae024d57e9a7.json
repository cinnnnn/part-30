This leads to a duel with pistols between Don Pasquale and Antonio. Concha begs Don Pasquale not to hurt Antonio, and he shoots into the air. Don Pasquale is wounded by Antonio's shot, but not fatally. Concha asks Antonio to take her to Paris, but then leaves him for Don Pasquale.\n\nFilm told in flashbacks of an older man's obsession for a woman who can belong to no-one but can frustrate everyone. The backdrop is SternbergÃƒï¿½s surreal and fantastic Carnaval in Spain. In a cafÃƒÂ© the older man details his encounters with the heart breaker that his younger friend has only just met at the parade. Forewarned, the young man swears he will avoid the fate of his friend, but rushes all the same to his evening rendezvous.
