As if it were not enough that his life as a software innovator is unraveling--a dark-suited man in an armored SUV is trying to assassinate him.\n\nAs Joex struggles to understand why he must die, he discovers a larger conspiracy against the West by forces secret, arcane and overwhelming. Will the total electronic financial and infrastructure cyberattack begin not just a war, but an entirely new civilization?\n\nAnd why does the Universal Church of the Crux with its psychopathic genius leader Michael Voide lead the attack against Joex using both his corrupt followers within the government and VoideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite personal angels? Angels more familiar with a Glock than the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crux InaequalisÃ¢â‚¬â€the unbalanced cross.\n\nWhy would an old man in an unkempt warehouse near the harbor of Hangzhou need a fly whisk made from sapphire fiber and petabytes collected from the Celestial Sphere?\n\nCan Joex connect with the adventurous woman Margaret who knows the hidden gateway to the covert prophets Xtance and quant Jimmy Hoffa? And what crucial role does West African boy, Sam, who has a gift for the deep web even as he owns no shoes have: is he--along with a troupe of MIT scientists, jugglers and libertines--the key to protecting the country?\n\n&quot;Perfect combination of Wittgenstein, assassination, complexity theory, high-tech cults, Sun Tzu, love, and microcode.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f24ffe3c58168c67c278fe9cc78ccfecebf690e","amp;dn":"Ward%2C+Grady+-+Celestial+Instructi0n","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f24ffe3c58168c67c278fe9cc78ccfecebf690e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,36,255,227,197,129,104,198,124,39,143,233,204,120,204,254,206,191,105,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
