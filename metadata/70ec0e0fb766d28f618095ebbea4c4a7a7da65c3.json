It's clear that Northern Uproar learned their Clash riffs secondhand through the Manics and lifted the rest of their sound -- as well as their apolitical, laddish attitude -- from Oasis. At their best, the band can tear through appealingly raucous and melodic rock &amp; roll with brutal, youthful energy. At their worst, the group wants to prove that they're more than a rock &amp; roll band, so they head down slow, string-laden detours. At this point in their career, Northern Uproar doesn't have the depth to pull off ballads, but that's fine, given their age. Northern Uproar certainly isn't a consistent album but it is fun, if occasionally mindless, rock &amp; roll.
