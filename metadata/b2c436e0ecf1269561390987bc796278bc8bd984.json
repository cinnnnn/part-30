The first initiation was 22 Dreams, 2008's restless, double-album exploration of folk and beyond. In 2010 came Wake Up the Nation, whose purpose was, again, to sort the men from the superannuated boys for whom Weller remained preserved in heroic amber. Sonik Kicks, his 11th solo album, proposes his most cosmic test thus far.\nFeaturing future Weller classics such as new single 'That Dangerous Age' and the previously released 'Around The Lake', 'Sonik Kicks' finds Paul at the height of his songwriting powers; pushing the boundaries and revelling in a new palate of influences, &quot; eclectic &quot;, would be the right word. \n\nEnjoy and Share please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c436e0ecf1269561390987bc796278bc8bd984","amp;dn":"Paul+Weller...Sonik+Kicks%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c436e0ecf1269561390987bc796278bc8bd984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,196,54,224,236,241,38,149,97,57,9,135,188,121,98,120,188,139,217,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
