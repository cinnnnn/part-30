Ours has tiny copyright\n                               writing on the edge of the disc (each region is supposed to have that, theirs obviously hasn't).\n                               Our guess it that TWIZTED's source is the same as METIS/AVS720's or at least similar, some kind\n                               of chinese bootleg with fake art disc.\n                               Shout out to the real sceners out there, and to all the sceners wannabees, \n                               please make sure you have a valid source and don't waste our time.
