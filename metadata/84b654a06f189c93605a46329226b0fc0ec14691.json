But Ruark Beauchamp's destiny is now eternally intertwined with his exquisite, tempestuous Shanna's. And no iron ever forged can imprison his magnificent passion . . . and no hangman's noose will deny him the ecstasy that is rightfully his.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b654a06f189c93605a46329226b0fc0ec14691","amp;dn":"Kathleen+Woodiwiss_Shanna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b654a06f189c93605a46329226b0fc0ec14691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,182,84,160,111,24,156,147,96,90,70,50,146,38,176,252,14,193,70,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
