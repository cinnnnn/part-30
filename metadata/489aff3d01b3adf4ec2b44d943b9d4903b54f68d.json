Hailing from Canvey Island, Essex, they are best known for early singles like &quot;Back in the Night&quot; and &quot;Roxette&quot;. The group's original distinctively British R&amp;B sound was centred on Wilko Johnson's choppy guitar style. Along with Johnson, the original band line-up included singer Lee Brilleaux and the rhythm section of John B. Sparks, known as &quot;Sparko&quot;, on bass guitar[1] and John Martin, known as &quot;The Big Figure&quot;, on drums. Although their most commercially productive years were the early to mid-1970s, and in spite of Brilleaux's death in 1994 of lymphoma, a version of the band (featuring none of the original members) continues to tour and record to this day.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrivate Practice was the sixth album by Dr. Feelgood, and was released in October 1978.\n\nThis was commercially rewarding when the album spawned a Top 10 hit single (the only one of their career) in &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;. Their preceding single release, &quot;Down at the Doctors&quot;, which also appeared on Private Practice 's tracklisting, topped out at number 48 in the same UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe album peaked at number 41 in the UK Albums Chart on the 7 October 1978, and remained in that chart for five weeks.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n]\nLee Brilleaux: vocals, guitar, harmonica\n\nJohn B.
