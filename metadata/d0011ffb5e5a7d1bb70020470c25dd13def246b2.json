This is where I bought all of Iron Maiden's 12&quot; singles back in the day, and where I also purchadsed the Curse of the Pharaohs LP.  \n\nBoth CotP and this album are fan club releases, but are considered bootlegs.  For many years I could never find a decent copy of this online. The only one I ever found sounded like it was recorded with a microphone up to a speaker. So several years ago I decided to digitize my LP. Once I did so I realized that it could really use some work. The songs were from 3 shows, but jumbled up randomly. Parts were transferred out of phase. Parts sounded like crap. So I phase corrected the bad parts, took the bits of the separate shows and grouped them together and EQd them as well as possible. \n\nSince then I sold the album for a fair bit of cash. Then tragedy struck. An unfortunate harddrive crash left me without the lossless files, although I still had a CD burned of it. But again fate was out to destroy Fate. A girlfriend made off with about 700 CDS of mine, including this one. If not for my son having a backup mp3 in his collection the entire thing would have been lost for good.\n\nSo what I've done is this:  I used an online LP rip stream as a reference and recreated the album from the same soundboard taped they used to make it themselves (actually my source tapes sounded, for the most part, better than the ones used on the original LP).  I've retained the order used on LftDoH and I've recreated the editing as well (except that I've tightened up some of the really sloppy hard cuts on the original album).  The only major flaw is The Oath.  This was one of three songs not broadcast over the radio from the Hilversum show.  The source tape for this track is of worse quality than the remainder of the songs from this show.\n\n\n01 Intro\n02 Black Masses\n03 Curse of the Pharaoks\n04 Evil\n05 Into the Coven\n06 Gypsy\n07 Reyarp Sdrol\n08 A Corpse Without Soul\n09 The Oath\n10 At the Sound of the Demon Bell\n11 Doomed by the Living Dead\n12 Satan's Fall\n13 Satan's Solo\n14 Nuns Have No Fun\n\nTracks 2-4, 6 &amp; 9 Hilversum, Netherlands 1/20/94\nTracks 5, 7 &amp; 8 from Odd Fellow PalÃƒÂ¦et in Copenhagen, Denmark 10/5/82\nTracks 10-14 from Aardschok Festival, Zwolle, Holland\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0011ffb5e5a7d1bb70020470c25dd13def246b2","amp;dn":"Mercyful+Fate+-+Live+From+The+Depths+Of+Hell+%28recreated+by+%7D%7Beyw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0011ffb5e5a7d1bb70020470c25dd13def246b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,1,31,251,94,90,125,27,183,0,32,71,12,37,221,19,222,242,70,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
