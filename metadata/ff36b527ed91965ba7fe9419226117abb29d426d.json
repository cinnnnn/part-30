PLAY AND ENJOY!\n\nThis cyberpunk-inspired game takes place during the year 2027, 25 years before Deus Ex. Nanotechnological augmentations have yet to be developed and biomechanical augmentations are the current state of the art. The player's character, Adam Jensen (voiced by Elias Toufexis), is a private security officer with Sarif Industries, a leading biotech company that specializes in human augmentations. After an attack on his company leaves him horrifically injured and forced to undergo augmentation to survive, &quot;the conspiracy begins.&quot;[13] The player travels to several locations over the course of the game: Detroit, Hengsha (a fictional city on Hengsha Island in the Yangtze River near Shanghai), Montreal, Singapore, and Panchaea, a facility in the Arctic Ocean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff36b527ed91965ba7fe9419226117abb29d426d","amp;dn":"%5BISO%5DDeus+Ex+-+Human+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff36b527ed91965ba7fe9419226117abb29d426d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,54,181,39,237,145,150,91,167,254,148,25,34,97,23,171,178,157,66,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
