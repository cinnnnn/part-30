Rejected by public school systems, churches, and other forms of socially acceptable activities he found a love for music. Most of his time was spent playing on a 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fun MachineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ In his youth, composing, learning, and producing his own music even at the young age of 10 soon after learning other instruments such as the guitar and bass he flourished as a young musician. \n\n Not long after hitting his teenage years he found a obsession with the occult, being turned away from church and Ã¢â‚¬Å“godÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he found a path to a more dark way of life, Satanism. Reading Anton Laveys Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Satanic BibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and all of its companions, he soon became secluded from the outside world. Laveys writings were never enough, he soon delved into many books by Aleister Crowley, The man who was once labeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The most wicked man on earthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and other occult related books such as the Necronomicon, The Black Arts, And many books on Necromancy and Necromantik Rites.\n\n This opened a new world for him and would come into play much more then he thought in his daily life. In early high school he found a love for industrial and electronica music, being influenced by groups such as nine inch nails and ministry he decided to self produce and release his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Subleminal IntentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ project, otherwise known as S.IN. The self produced and released album sold over 2500 copies on a self made, non domain named website, and over 1500 hundred copies locally. With the albums success, he found that this is what he wanted to do with his life, and that it was a very promising future. Later in life he found a love for heavy metal, influenced by such bands as slayer, deicide, cannibal corpse, deeds of flesh, mayhem, emperor, and dark funeral, he decided to join the local death metal band Ã¢â‚¬Å“convulsionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was later named Ã¢â‚¬Å“necromemisisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, necromemisis quickly grew in popularity in the Albuquerque metal scene, playing with top local bands, and big underground metal acts such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“nileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“goregasmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\n However problems in the bands ranks of authority caused him to leave necromemisis. In early 2002, lost, on cocaine, suicidal, and with no direction SickTanicK Tha Souless met Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zodiak KillaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at a Albuquerque restaurant, discussing music and life in general the two grew close very quickly, and as time went buy, he was exposed to more underground music and people alike. As a joke in passing he recorded a song entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gothic Poser FaggotsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on his computer mic, over an internet found rap instrumental beat. This caught the attention of Zodiak, who had a local record label named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Serial Killin RecordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Zodiak asked him to make a beat (knowing of previous production experience) and rap over it. SickTanicK Tha Souless then produced and recorded his then infamous song entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“CuttenemupÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Shocked by the brutal lyrics Zodiak added SickTanicK on the Serial Killin Records roster, not only as a artist but as the head producer for all artists on SKR. \n\n SickTanicKs first performance was on new years eve 2003, drawing a small crowd of fifty people he unleashed his venom for the first time on stage, shocking listeners with his brutal straight out lyrics and fuck you attitude, the response was not only shocking, but phenomenal as well. Getting a strong following very quickly, it was seen at that point, SickTanicK Tha Souless could not be stopped, but his lyrics were just the first part of the controversy that would later be imposed on him. In later show dates, as crowdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapidly grew SickTanicK became synonymous with the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“insaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“offensiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, once beating himself to concussion with the microphone and leaving many lacerations in his head, he proved this was no game and he was to be taken very seriously by his fans (also known as disciples). At a later date he covered a bible with blood and ripped it up, showering the crowd with bible paper, causing many people in the crowd to leave in anger and in fright, but also bringing a new array of people into his shows. \n\n Now its 2006 much has changedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ SickTanicKs debut EP Premantions dropped August 20th 2005, selling very strongly on a worldwide basis SickTanicK has grown in popularity and has become even more radical with his live performance's and lyrics, recording songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“black christmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“i love nothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“unholy executionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ SickTanicK is proving that the wickedshit will never die on his watch. Performing live with artists like Ã¢â‚¬Å“MarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ADR LaveyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shy OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cap One of Simken HeightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Andybody KillaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and many others, SickTanicK along with the rest of Serial Killin Records is determined to Put the Southwest on the map for this genre. Whether or not its the fact that SickTanicK beats himself bloody every show, hits and abuses the crowd at his shows and welcomes abuse back, or the fact that his lyrics are considered anti Semite, Muslim, and Christian, SickTanicK has made his mark in this genre and will continue breaking boundaries.\n\n As 2007 approaches SickTanicK Tha Souless is working on the anticipated Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chapter 1 : Doctrines Of Tha DamnedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and promises this album to be shit straight from the mouth of the devil himselfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Only time will tell where SickTanicK is heading but one thing is for sureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ SickTanicK represents a darker much more serious part of this genre, and is a force to be reckoned with. 2007 : Chapter One Doctrines of the damned SOLD OUT in one weeks time along with all other SKR releases, more shows have been done, bloodier, more violent, and the SKR fan cult is emerging to become a strong underground cult following, new additions and losses to SickTanicKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label, has made SKR a internationally known and recognized entity in the underground, selling units as far as Slovakia &amp; The Netherlands, collaborating and performing with more established and well known underground acts. Controversy also follows in 2007 when the second annual Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show was cancelled by the Albuquerque City Council due to its content. SKR is now unable to perform in New Mexico for the time being.\n\n Irrigardless of controversy SickTanicK &amp; Serial Killin Records move on into 2008 with a much more raw and established attitude in the underground, with a 12 month consecutive release schedule and a full merchandise line on the way, Serial Killin Records and its Affiliate labels and artists, promises to dominate not only the underground sales scheme, but promises to give its fans a quality product for an affordable and fair price.\n\n SKR continues to sell and gain a strong cult following in the underground, with disciples taking communion state to state, fans getting SKR inked on themselves in permanent form, shows continue to grow, sales continue to increase, and the sickness continues to spread. As always, time will tell what SickTanicK &amp; SKR holds for the future, but the future is only a tomorrow away, and yesterday was another day in the books of underground history. \n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like SickTanicK then buy all his shit, please support the artists you like this is years of hard work. Leave a comment &amp; rate this download &amp; please seed this takes a lot of time &amp; effort I cant do it all myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a9019b233ec9dd408ce7aa7afa60d8d8aeed59","amp;dn":"SickTanicK+Tha+Souless+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a9019b233ec9dd408ce7aa7afa60d8d8aeed59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,169,1,155,35,62,201,221,64,140,231,170,122,250,96,216,216,174,237,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
