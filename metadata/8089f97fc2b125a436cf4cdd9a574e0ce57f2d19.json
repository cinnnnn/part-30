Both share a love of dusty old record shops, 45s, Sci-Fi films ,funky Blues, Soul &amp; Jazz. Their sound is inspired by Hip-Hop mega-producers like Pete Rock, DJ Premier &amp; Diamond D as well as older innovative producers like Quincy Jones, David Axelrod &amp; James Brown. Their first LP DYNAMISM (Ninjatune 1999) got rave reviews. DSP return in 2002 with a new LP IN THE RED.\n\nSince the last LP DSP have toured extensively in Europe alongside the Herbaliser, Kid Koala and Nightmares On Wax. Working hard in the studio &amp; travelling back and forth to New York for recording sessions. DSP have had music featured on TV and in video games; EAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Knockout Kings 2001, NBA Street &amp; SEGA Extreme Sports.\n\nIN THE RED combines the lyrical skills of UK and US emcees going toe to toe with DSPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heavyweight beats. Favourites from the last LP MASS INFLUENCE &amp; JUICE ALEEM are back in action, along with old school legend CHILL ROB G the Original (I got the Power). Added to the mix are rising stars like APATHY, DEF TEX &amp; PHI-LIFE CYPHER (recently seen performing at the Brit Awards with the GORILLAZ). IN THE RED also showcases exclusive unsigned talents like Brooklyn emcee DELL WELLS and EV.ON who stole the show from the FUGEES at Wembley Arena and recently performed for the HEARTLESS CREW on Radio 1. IN THE RED delivers a musical punch that rocks any dancefloor &amp; still sounds dope when you get home.\n\nNinjatune\nhttp://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/release.php?id=586\n\nTracks\n1. Intro\n2.
