As of now gamepad companion is on version 3.2, if anyone has a copy of this please share\n\nits not current but it works (10.6,10.7,10.8, 10.9)  \nso.. as always much love from canada :)\n\n\n.................................................................................\n\n\n\nGamePad Companion 3.1.1 [k'ed]\n\n\n\nGamePad Companion enables you to configure your gaming device to act as a keyboard or mouse. With GamePad Companion you can use your gaming devices with every game and app, even if they don't have built-in support for those devices!\n\nGamePad Companion works with all gaming devices that conform to the USB HID (Human Interface Device) standard. For more information on devices you can visit GamePad Companion support.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 3.1.1\n\n1.&quot;Enable mice&quot; adds support for HID (Human Interface Device) USB mice. *This feature was added for the purpose of configuring the buttons on some USB mice that do not already have values assigned to their buttons, for example the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right Click, Left Click, and Center ClickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ buttons already have values. It is not meant for gaming mice, and will not override the mouse functions of any button that has a pre-configured value. This is meant for the average user, with a mouse that has 2 or 3 extra buttons and wishes to configure those buttons for functionality.\n\n2. Adds linguistic support so that GamePad Companion can be used with both the Italian, and Spanish languages.\n\n3. Minor changes to the UI (User Interface) by moving the location of &quot;Steam Mode&quot; and adding the &quot;Enable Mice&quot; check boxes to the &quot;Options...&quot; menu. \n\nRequirements: OS X 10.6 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:359f08a48a1742da3357613c3e76283c63159f11","amp;dn":"Gamepad+Companion+3.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"359f08a48a1742da3357613c3e76283c63159f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,159,8,164,138,23,66,218,51,87,97,60,62,118,40,60,99,21,159,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
