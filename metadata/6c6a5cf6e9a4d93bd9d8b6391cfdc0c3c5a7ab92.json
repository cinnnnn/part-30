He's reluctant to spend the time: his health is fading and he wants to finish one more book. He's also worried about his daughter, Ariel, who's approaching 40, underemployed, single and wanting a child. But he agrees, hoping Heather can help resurrect interest in his work. As Heather probes Frank's writing and his past, Ariel reconnects to a former lover.\n\nBonus: Audio commentary, trailer, TV spot\n\n\nMy connection is slow and sporadic, so please have patience, but I will seed this to completion eventually.\n\nLeave feedback if you like. As always, please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6a5cf6e9a4d93bd9d8b6391cfdc0c3c5a7ab92","amp;dn":"Starting+out+in+the+Evening+2007+Frank+Langella+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6a5cf6e9a4d93bd9d8b6391cfdc0c3c5a7ab92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,106,92,246,233,164,217,59,217,216,182,57,28,253,192,195,197,167,171,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
