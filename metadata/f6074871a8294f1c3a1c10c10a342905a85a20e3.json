Are you tired\n\nof having to wait for 5 seconds before you can logon to your computer\n\nand you badly needed a windows genuine validation tool to solve the\n\nproblem?How badly do you need the windows xp activation software?\n\nAre you tired of the windows notification pop up telling you that\n\nyou may be a victim of a software counterfeiting? Has this notification\n\nchanged your desktop to total black color? Are you thinking of formatting\n\nyour computer? Remember you have files that you donÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t want to lose.\n\n\n\nRemoveWGA will enable you to easily remove the Microsoft &quot;Windows Genuine\n\nAdvantage Notifications&quot; tool, which is calling home and connect to MS servers\n\nevery time you boot.\n\nFutures updates of this notification tool will (officialy) setup the connection\n\nrate to once every two weeks.\n\nOnce the WGA Notification tool has checked your OS and has confirmed you had a\n\nlegit copy, there is no decent point or reason to check it again and again every boot.\n\nMoreover, connecting to Microsoft brings security issue for corporate networks,\n\nand privacy issues for everyone. It is also unclear which information are transmitted\n\n(Microsoft published an official answer, but an individual study brought some questions).\n\nAll of that, along the fact that Microsoft used deceptive ways to make you install\n\nthis tool (it was told you it was an urgent security update, whereas it is a new\n\ninstallation giving you no extra security) makes me calling this tool a spyware.\n\nAlso, Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications is different than Windows Genuine Advantage\n\nValidation. RemoveWGA only removes the notification part, phoning home, and\n\ndoes not touch the Validation part.\n\nok now u can uninstall Windows &quot;Genuine Advantage\n\nNotifications&quot;WORKING....\n\n\n***************************************************************************************\nNote: Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag RemoveWGA as being infected/malware,\n\nalthough the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your\n\nsystem. This is called a 'false positive'. The term false positive is used when\n\nantivirus software wrongly classifies\n\nan innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to\n\nheuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. [Similar problems can\n\noccur with antitrojan or antispyware software.]\n\n\n\nDON&quot;T FORGET TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC UPDATES...THANKS..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6074871a8294f1c3a1c10c10a342905a85a20e3","amp;dn":"windows+genuine+advantage+notification.removal+tool.aaaevilaacha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6074871a8294f1c3a1c10c10a342905a85a20e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,7,72,113,168,41,79,28,58,28,16,193,10,52,41,5,168,90,32,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
