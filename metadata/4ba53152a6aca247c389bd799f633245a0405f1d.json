The Pimsleur Language Program is an integrated system which immerses you in the language, encouraging you to hear, understand and use the language all at the same time.\n\nAt the completion of these easy-to-use lessons, you will be able to comfortably understand Hebrew and speak with native speakers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba53152a6aca247c389bd799f633245a0405f1d","amp;dn":"Pimsleur+-+Hebrew+Short+Course+%5B96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba53152a6aca247c389bd799f633245a0405f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,165,49,82,166,172,162,71,195,137,189,121,159,99,50,69,160,64,95,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
