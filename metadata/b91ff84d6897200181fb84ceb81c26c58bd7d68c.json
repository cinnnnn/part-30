The final stage might be familiar but this year everything changes. A start inside the Palace of Versailles sees the race cross the Chevreuse valley, popular with local cyclos before reaching Paris for a finish with a difference. The race will use the entire length of the Champs ElysÃƒÂ©es, circling the Jardin des Tuileries at one end and the Arc de Triomphe at the other for a full lap. If this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spectacular enough it will be held as the sunsets and the Patrouille de France airforce will serenade the race. If Paris is in summer then there will surely never have been a stage finish as grand as this.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage21)\n\n\nSD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91ff84d6897200181fb84ceb81c26c58bd7d68c","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+21+-+Versailles+to+Paris+135km","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91ff84d6897200181fb84ceb81c26c58bd7d68c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,31,248,77,104,151,32,1,129,251,132,206,184,28,38,197,139,215,214,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
