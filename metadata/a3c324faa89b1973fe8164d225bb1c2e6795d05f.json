Research indicates that dandelion greens have anti-inflammatory properties; dandelion greens have diuretic properties and can be used for treating urinary tract infections. Their high potassium levels are great for treating sore muscles.\n\nAlthough dandelion greens can be harvested from your back yard, sometimes you can find them at your local farmers market in the spring. Dandelions are easy to identify because of their bright, distinct yellow flowers. (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dent de lionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means Ã¢â‚¬Å“lionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in French.)\n\nGrowing dandelions is like having a drugstore right at your doorstep! Every part of the plant is good for you. They are especially effective against indigestion, kidney and liver problems.\n\nYoung dandelion greens can be tossed in salads or brewed for tea, while older greens can be steamed like spinach. The roots can be roasted to make a tasty coffee substitute.\n\nOne cup of raw dandelion greens contains 25 calories, but is nutrition rich. They are filled with vitamins and minerals, especially calcium, potassium, iron, manganese and vitamins A, C and K.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c324faa89b1973fe8164d225bb1c2e6795d05f","amp;dn":"QuikGuide+to%3A+Dandelions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c324faa89b1973fe8164d225bb1c2e6795d05f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,195,36,250,168,155,25,115,254,129,100,210,37,187,28,46,103,149,208,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
