C:/Program Files/KSP)\n* If you plan to overwrite a previous version of KSP with this one, please delete the contents of the folder before unzipping.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAC USERS:\n* The Update Tool requires version 2.8 of the Mono Framework to run. The Mono 2.10.9 Runtime installer is included in the .zip file. Please install it if you are running a version earlier than 2.8, before running the game or patcher. (If you're unsure about your version of Mono, just run the installer).\nYou can check for the latest version of the Mono Framework Runtime here: http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html\n\nWARNING: It's very likely that parts and/or ships created on previous versions will be incompatible with the latest release. At this point in development it is quite impossible to ensure backward-compatibility at each step, so please keep this in mind. If you encounter something that could be a bug, try again on a fresh installation and no addon parts. It may just be an incompatibility issue.\n\n\n===================================================================================\nDisclaimer:\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN ALPHA STATE, AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS. SQUAD AND SQUAD STAFF TAKE NO\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT MAY OCCUR AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT RESULT OF USING\nTHIS SOFTWARE.
