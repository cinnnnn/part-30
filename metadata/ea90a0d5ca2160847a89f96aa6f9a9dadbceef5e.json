StradiPad is created to fulfill your demand for synthetic strings, synth pad and acoustical string instruments tracks processing. Normally, you don't need more than one instance of StradiPad on your track to obtain a finished sound which stays in the right place in the mix. Stradipad is a standalone plugin comparable to a real hardware-chain often composed by unique and unobtainable devices.\n\n\n\n   Sampling Process\n\nEvery chain has been precisely sampled with custom converters built specifically for this purpose, high end cables, with particular care to the connections, levels and impedance matching. They are accurately programmed without destructive digital processing for optimized sound, performance and CPU load. The result is a no-compromise, high quality, professional plugin sampled at 44.1kHz and 96kHz without introduction of noise or aliasing, which gives an analog and organic sound with a wide, deep and holographic soundstage. StradiPad doesn't sound processed, harsh or digital as most plugins do, but it sounds like a natural extension of the original audio, gluing your tracks in the mix with an analog vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Controls\n\nInput Gain: sets the level at the input of the plugin. The range is from -Ã¢Ë†Å¾ dB to +6 dB.\n\nOutput Gain: sets the level at the output of the plugin. The range is from -8 dB to +6 dB.\nHigh Pass Filter: These control switches engage the HPF by clicking ON or OFF. The HPF has fixed frequency at 70Hz and the slope is 18dB per octave.\n\nWarmth: The Warmth control drives the input stage of the plugin changing the harmonic saturation by rising the input level without changing the output level.\n\nVU Meters: Input and Output VU Meters display the levels at the input and output of the plugin.\n\nRed Led: Red Led lights when clipping occours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Presets\n\n\nEvery preset has been sampled and created for the specific sound identified in the name using different hardware and settings, however you can use them for any sound source that suits your taste.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n   Sys Requirements\n\nWindows Minumum\n\nXp Sp2\nRam 2 Gb\nHd 120 Gb\nScreen Resolution 1024x768\nAudio Host VST compatible\nCPU Dual Core\n\nWindows Recommended\n\nLatest 64 bits version\n\nRam 24 Gb\nHd 120 Gb SSD\nScreen Resolution Full Hd\nAudio Host VST compatible\nLatest multicore CPU\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n  UnRaR\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run our keygen.\n4.Select a product.\n5.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n6.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\nOur Keygen gets Challenge Code automatically from your computer.\nHowever, you can get that code manually.\nChallenge Codes are identical for all plugins.\n(You don't need to load *.SER file one by one).\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install the plugin.\n3.Run the plugin.\n *.SER (Challenge Code File) will be generated.\n4.Run our keygen.\n5.Select a product.\n6.Click &quot;Get From File&quot; and open that *.SER file.\n7.Click GENERATE to generate *.AUT file.\n8.Save *.AUT to the same location to the plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
