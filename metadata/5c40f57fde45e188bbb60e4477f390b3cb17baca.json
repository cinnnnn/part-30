For decades Lewin s GENES has provided the teaching community with the most cutting edge presentation of molecular biology and molecular genetics, covering gene structure, sequencing, organization, and expression. The latest edition, with a knowledgeable new author team, has enlisted 21 scientists to provide revisions and content updates in their individual fields of expertise, ensuring that Lewin s GENES X is the most current and comprehensive text in the field. Informative new chapters, as well as a reorganization of material, provide a more logical flow of topics and many chapters have been renamed to better indicate their contents. Lewin s GENES X also contains new pedagogical features to help students learn as they read and an online student study guide allows students to test themselves on key material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c40f57fde45e188bbb60e4477f390b3cb17baca","amp;dn":"Lewin+Genes+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c40f57fde45e188bbb60e4477f390b3cb17baca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,64,245,127,222,69,225,136,187,182,14,68,119,243,144,179,203,23,186,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
