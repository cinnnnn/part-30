Here is the food Eva loves to eat, and the recipes in Evaâ€™s Kitchen trace her life story, taking readers on her culinary journeyâ€”from the food she was brought up on to the recipes inspired by her travels abroad to the dishes she serves during casual nights at home.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up on a ranch with every meal based on what was in the family fields, Eva believes, like so many of us, that good cooking relies on local, fresh, easy-to-find ingredients. In Evaâ€™s Kitchen, she teaches readers essential cooking skills and she sprinkles in the histories and traditions behind her favorite dishes, including personal stories and anecdotes that capture the warmth, humor, and joy of her most memorable meals.\r\n\r\nIn her first cookbook, Eva welcomes you into her kitchen, offering 100 of her favorite dishesâ€”many of which are family recipes collected over the yearsâ€”all fused with her passion for cooking. She also shares memories of her Texas ranch upbringing, her very first cooking adventures, vacations overseas, nights in with her girlfriends, and last-minute preâ€“red carpet meals. \r\n\r\nInspired by her heritage, Eva highlights the essentials of great Mexican cooking, Texas styleâ€”with her familyâ€™s recipes and techniques for making the worldâ€™s best tamales, homemade tortillas, Spanish rice, and Pan de Polvo (Mexican pastry), to name a few. She also offers dishes from a variety of international cuisines, from Latin American to Italian and French, inspired by her globe-trotting travels. A taste of Lemon Dover Sole whisks Eva to a tiny hotel-restaurant she once visited on a trip to Normandy; the recipe for Cannellini Beans with Crushed Red Pepper was a souvenir from a trip to Florence; kimchi adds a kick to her Spicy Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Thanksgiving staple; and Yellow Squash Soup with Lemon brings her full circle, back to her familyâ€™s vegetable garden in Corpus Christi.\r\n\r\nWith full-color food photographs, intimate portraits of her family and friends, and a glimpse into Evaâ€™s home and her lesser-known domestic side (family first, acting second, she says), Evaâ€™s debut cookbook will entice her loyal fans and inspire home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons and create memorable meals for the people they love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089dadeb0b636b2477dbdd8224ea1a4563218b95","amp;dn":"Eva%27s+Kitchen+%282011%29+%28Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089dadeb0b636b2477dbdd8224ea1a4563218b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,157,173,235,11,99,107,36,119,219,221,130,36,234,26,69,99,33,139,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
