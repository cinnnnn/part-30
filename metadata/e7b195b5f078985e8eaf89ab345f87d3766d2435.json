But more than this, Jean Vanier writes with a go-to-the-heart simplicity that makes the man Jesus come alive in all his humanity, revealing his immense goodness and his bountiful love for everyone he meets. This book is the story of Jesus as it is told in the four Gospels, brought together into one meditation. The author says that, &quot;Together they give a clear portrait of Jesus as he was and as he lived, a clear vision of his message. From his conception to his death and resurrection, we see a man manifestly sent by God to reveal God, to point to a way of universal love, of truth, of justice, and of peace.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b195b5f078985e8eaf89ab345f87d3766d2435","amp;dn":"Jean+Vanier+-+Jesus%2C+the+Gift+of+Love+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b195b5f078985e8eaf89ab345f87d3766d2435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,177,149,181,240,120,152,94,142,175,137,171,52,95,135,211,118,109,36,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
