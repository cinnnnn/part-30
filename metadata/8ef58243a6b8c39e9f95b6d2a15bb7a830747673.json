The first three singles released from the album, (&quot;Lollipop&quot;, &quot;A Milli&quot;, and &quot;Got Money&quot;) all achieved Top 10 success on the Billboard Hot 100. The fourth single, &quot;Mrs. Officer&quot;, reached the Top 20 within 4 weeks of Wayne confirming the song to be an official single. The album received positive reviews from several music critics and publications, while it also earned general universal acclaim, according to the website aggregator Metacritic. On New Year's Eve, it was named the top-selling album of 2008 in the United States, selling 2.88 million copies. Due to an original December 11, 2007 release date, Tha Carter III was named the &quot;#1 most anticipated album of 2007&quot; by XXL and the #3 album of 2008 by Rolling Stone. The cover, featuring a baby picture of Lil Wayne, follows designs of album covers done by American rappers Nas (Illmatic) and The Notorious B.I.G. (Ready to Die). In December 2008, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the 51st Grammy Awards, winning the Best Rap Album award.\n\nRollingstone.com Review By Jody Rosen - OK, it's true: he really is the best rapper alive. Lil Wayne made that claim on his last official CD, in 2005, and since then, he's unleashed an astonishing torrent of mixtapes, leaks and guest appearances to back up the boast. So his long-anticipated &quot;legit&quot; album follow-up feels a bit gratuitous. Still, Tha Carter III is useful as an exclamation point. It establishes beyond a doubt that the zeitgeist in 2008 belongs to one artist: a dreadlocked dadaist poet from New Orleans with a bad weed habit and a voice like a bullfrog. As Wayne croaks in the woozy &quot;3Peat,&quot; &quot;Get on my level/You can't get on my level/You will need a space shuttle/Or a ladder that's forever.&quot;  Wayne has taken the task of album-making seriously: This isn't a mixtape, it's a suite of songs, paced and sequenced for maxaqimum impact. He's collected sleek, powerful beats from top producers (Kanye West, Swizz Beatz), enlisted A-list guest stars (Jay-Z, T-Pain) and served up a range of textures and moods, from the elegiac Hurricane Katrina protest &quot;Tie My Hands&quot; to the bubblegum bumper &quot;Lollipop,&quot; in which Weezy has a laugh at selling out by creating the most outrageously pumped-up sellout single in history. Thematically, Carter III is a victory lap. In the hilarious &quot;Dr Carter,&quot; he boasts about resuscitating hip-hop: &quot;As I put the light down his throat/I can only see flow/His blood's starting to flow/His lungs starting to grow.&quot;  As usual, Wayne's tumbling freestyle rhymes are full of imagination and surprise, but his voice itself is half the fun. He shouts, gasps, tries a Caribbean patois, sings snatches of &quot;Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Irreplaceable,&quot; and impersonates E.T. He loves that brother-from-another-planet stuff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;I am a Martian,&quot; he raps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but it's clear he's also thinking about his worldly legacy. The album cover links Carter III to Biggie's Ready to Die and Nas' Illmatic, and he makes no bones about coveting a spot in hip-hop's pantheon. &quot;Next time you mention Pac, Biggie or Jay-Z/Don't forget Weezy Baby,&quot; he advises on &quot;Mr Carter.&quot; It's sound advice. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] 3 Peat\n[02] Mr. Carter            \t---&gt; Featuring Jay-Z\n[03] A Milli\n[04] Got Money             \t---&gt; Featuring T-Pain\n[05] Comfortable        \t---&gt;  Featuring Babyface\n[06] Dr. Carter\n[07] Phone Home\n[08] Tie My Hands          \t---&gt; Featuring Robin Thicke\n[09] Mrs. Officer          \t---&gt; Featuring Bobby V\n[10] Let The Beat Build\n[11] Shoot Me Down          \t---&gt; Featuring D.
