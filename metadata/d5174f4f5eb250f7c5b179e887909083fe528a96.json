The 7-song EP was recorded in Brooklyn at GaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Electric by Al Carlson in January. The love of dreamy, fuzzy, handcrafted guitar-pop isn't far removed from the Radio Dept. or The Pains Of Being Pure at Heart, but they display a more comprehensive and widespread commitment to classic indie pop sound. Revivalism notwithstanding, the craftsmanship is undeniable and the details are spot-on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5174f4f5eb250f7c5b179e887909083fe528a96","amp;dn":"Wild+Nothing+-+Empty+Estate+2013+%5BScene-V0%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5174f4f5eb250f7c5b179e887909083fe528a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,23,79,79,94,178,80,247,197,177,121,232,135,144,144,131,254,82,138,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
