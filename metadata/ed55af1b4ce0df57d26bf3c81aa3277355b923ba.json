You might have contacted hp already to get to know that they will charge you for shipping you the CD-ROM. Also you might know that the software on this CD-ROM is essential for many tasks such as scanning from your PC. While hp provides the software updates (4.4) on their support website, they don't provide a downloadable version of the original software. Meaning that if you ever had to reinstall your XP and can't find your CD-ROM you will be left with a printer which will never fully function again as day one, unless you install the original software from the CD-ROM it came with.\n\nAll you need to do is burn the .ISO file with your prefered CD burning software and intall.\n\nNOTE: Users of F-Secure Security Suite and most other anti-virus brands MUST disable temporarily their software as it is recommended when installing new device drivers. Best option is simply to run 'msconfig.exe' at a command prompt and disable all items from the 'Startup' tab and all Non-Microsoft Services from the 'Services' tab. Then reboot, install CD-ROM software. After installation is complete run 'msconfig.exe' again, and select 'Normal startup' from the 'General' tab, and reboot.\n\n\nHope this helps anyone out there.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  \n\n     Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 3300 Series Software Version 4.0\n                 Late Breaking Readme\n\nThe Late-Breaking Readme file contains information that may impact \nthe installation and use of your HP LaserJet 3300 Series printer.  \n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  \n\nReadMe File Contents:\n\nI.
