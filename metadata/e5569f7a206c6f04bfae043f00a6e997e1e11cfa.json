Maddux and Winstead have brought together the most distinguished researchers in the fields of clinical psychology and psychopathology in order to provide up-to-date information about theory and research, as well as to challenge students to think critically about psychopathology. Thoroughly revised and updated from the previous edition, the book focuses throughout on what has been demonstrated by research, not on what has been claimed by theories that may be accepted or traditional but lack empirical support. The first section presents and analyzes the basic concepts we need to understand any disorder; the second examines the disorders most frequently encountered in clinical practice. \n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 472 pages\n# Publisher: Routledge; 2 edition (December 13, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0805861696\n# ISBN-13: 978-0805861693","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5569f7a206c6f04bfae043f00a6e997e1e11cfa","amp;dn":"Psychopathology%3A+Foundations+for+a+Contemporary+Understanding+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5569f7a206c6f04bfae043f00a6e997e1e11cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,86,159,122,32,108,111,4,191,174,4,63,0,166,233,151,225,225,28,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
