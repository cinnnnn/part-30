Bonus Track\n\nAn amazing display of talent form a not so well known classical guitarist. Marc Rizzo is recognized for his work with heavy metal band Ill Nino, but this is a complete departure from the distorted power chords and crunching low tones he is used to playing. While there is some electric guitar weaved into a few of the tracks it is mainly all classical acoustic playing. A must have for any fan of great guitar work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61334d5090b56b6b2b5c0b4ba48d3bbcc9e8dec3","amp;dn":"Marc+Rizzo+-+Colossal+Myopia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61334d5090b56b6b2b5c0b4ba48d3bbcc9e8dec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,51,77,80,144,181,107,107,43,92,11,75,164,141,59,188,201,232,222,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
