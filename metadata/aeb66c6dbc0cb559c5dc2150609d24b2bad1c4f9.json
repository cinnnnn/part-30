Her husband, a surgeon, saved her life on the spot, but when she was safely home she couldn't just go on with her life. She had entered an even more profound survival journey: the aftermath. \n\nThe survival experience changes everything because it invalidates all your previous adaptations, and the old rules don't apply. In some cases survivors suffer more in the aftermath than they did during the actual crisis. In all cases, they have to work hard to reinvent themselves. \n\nDrawing on gripping cases across a wide range of life-threatening experiences, Laurence Gonzales fashions a compelling argument about fear, courage, and the adaptability of the human spirit. Micki Glenn was later moved to say: I don't regret that this happened to me. It has been . . . probably the single most positive experience I've ever had.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Psychology | Science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb66c6dbc0cb559c5dc2150609d24b2bad1c4f9","amp;dn":"Surviving+Survival+by+Laurence+Gonzales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb66c6dbc0cb559c5dc2150609d24b2bad1c4f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,182,108,109,188,12,181,89,197,220,33,80,96,157,36,178,186,209,196,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
