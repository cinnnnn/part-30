The series chronicles the life of a young man named Tavi in the empire of Alera on the world of Carna. Every Aleran of every nation and caste, except for Tavi, has some degree of command over elemental forces or spirits called furies. The story takes place after the rise of a fictional empire similar to Rome where the First Lord must stave off in-fighting amongst the nobility of a now decadent empire and wield the throne through sheer force of strength and will. Tavi, trapped by fate in the midst of conflicts at home and abroad, must use all of his intelligence to save Alera.\n\nFomat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357e141e7e9cd346b630030a2021dec08356d2bf","amp;dn":"Jim+Butcher+-+Codex+Alera+Book+4+-+Captain%5C%27s+Fury+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357e141e7e9cd346b630030a2021dec08356d2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,126,20,30,126,156,211,70,182,48,3,10,32,33,222,192,131,86,210,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
