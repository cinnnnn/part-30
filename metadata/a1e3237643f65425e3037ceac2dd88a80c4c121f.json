The CD has a sticker still on it \nsaying it's limited to 250 copies . Like it or loath it, I don't care.\n( Not a big fan myself give me the original any day )\nReview comments found on the web below. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n1 Speak To Me / Breathe (7:55) \t\n2 On The Run (9:13) \t\n3 Time (7:35) \t\n4 The Great Gig In The Sky (9:54) \t\n5 Money (8:15) \t\n6 Us And Them (8:45) \t\n7 Any Colour You Like (7:35) \t\n8 Brain Damage \t(13:30)\n\n&quot;This remix is also a little uneven. The &quot;Speak to Me: Breathe&quot; suite\nbegins with lots a drum machine noises and samples from the songs. \n&quot;On the Run&quot; and &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; are nice with lots of added \nkeyboard sounds to make the already ambient feel of the songs more potent.\nSurprisingly, both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; are weak. Parts\n of the songs are sampled over and over again, and make Clare Torry's \nbeautiful voice nothing more than a nerve grater on this one. Lots of \npotential lost on those two. &quot;Money&quot; has been turned into a typical dance\ntune that is nothing special. &quot;Us and Them&quot; is the strong point of disc. \nEcho effects and spacey vocals abound. &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is sparse at best. \nDon't rush out to listen to this one with headphones! Good try: B-\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e3237643f65425e3037ceac2dd88a80c4c121f","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Trance+Remix+Darkside+Of+The+Moon+Trance+Remix+%28MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e3237643f65425e3037ceac2dd88a80c4c121f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,227,35,118,67,246,84,37,227,3,124,234,194,221,136,168,12,76,18,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
