Shephard (Editor), Stephen M. Kosslyn (Editor), Evelynn M. Hammonds (Editor)\nHardcover: 392 pages\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (November 14, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0674059026\nISBN-13: 978-0674059023\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nFrom Harvard University, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preeminent institutions of liberal education, comes a collection of essays sampling topics at the forefront of academia in the twenty-first century. Written by faculty members at the cutting edge of their fields, including such luminaries as Steven Pinker, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, and Harry R. Lewis, these essays offer a clear and accessible overview of disciplines that are shaping the culture, and even the world.\nThe authors, among the most respected members of HarvardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faculty, invite readers to explore subjects as diverse as religious literacy and Islam, liberty and security in cyberspace, medical science and epidemiology, energy resources, evolution, morality, human rights, global history, the dark side of the American Revolution, American literature and the environment, interracial literature, and the human mind. They summarize key developments in their fields in ways that will both entertain and edify those who seek an education beyond the confines of the classroom.\nIt is sometimes said that youth is wasted on the young. It could also be said that college, too often, is wasted on college studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€that only after graduating does a former student come to appreciate learning. To those wishing to revisit the college classroomÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as to those who never had the opportunity in the first placeÃ¢â‚¬â€this book gives a taste of the modern course at Harvard. The essays are stimulating and informative, and the annotated bibliographies accompanying each chapter provide invaluable guidance to the life-long learner who wants to pursue these fascinating topics in depth.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJennifer M. Shephard is Special Initiatives Program Manager, Division of Social Science, FAS, Harvard University.\nStephen M. Kosslyn is John Lindsley Professor of Psychology in Memory of William James, Emeritus, Harvard University, and Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.\nEvelynn M.

The concept is a fascinating one, and the essays, like short stories, are perfect for reading on the fly. I found some of them truly engaging and thought-provoking: Ali S. Asani on religious literacy and Islam is a favorite, and Steven Pinker on &quot;The Human Mind&quot; is eye-opening. Some of the other essays strike me as slender--the authors define their disciplines well but don't manage to tell a story or demonstrate a mode of investigation in the allotted 20-30 pages. I don't think I will be returning to this volume much in the future, but it was fun to dip into once.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16810551b7c9b2770c25c3ec2b578d5cced09ff9","amp;dn":"Jennifer+M.+Shephard+-+The+Harvard+Sampler+%5B2011%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16810551b7c9b2770c25c3ec2b578d5cced09ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,129,5,81,183,201,178,119,12,37,195,236,43,87,141,92,206,208,159,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
