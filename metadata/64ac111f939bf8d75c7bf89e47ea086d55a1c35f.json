This is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of Houdini's life, centering on one of his most famous jumps. As Houdini prepares for a death-defying leap into the icy Charles River in Boston, biographer Jason Lutes and artist Nick Bertozzi reveal Houdini's life and influence: from the anti-Semitism Houdini fought all his life, to the adulation of the American public; from his hounding by the press, to his loving relationship with his wife Bess; from his egoism to his insecurity; from his public persona - to the secret behind his most amazing trick! And it's all in graphic form, so it's fresh, original, and unlike anything previously published about this most fascinating of American showmen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ac111f939bf8d75c7bf89e47ea086d55a1c35f","amp;dn":"Houdini+-+The+Handcuff+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ac111f939bf8d75c7bf89e47ea086d55a1c35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,172,17,31,147,155,248,215,92,123,248,158,71,234,8,109,85,161,195,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
