The great news is that, once aware of this, these are entirely open to being changed! Why live in an emotional hell once you realize that what we're doing to ourselves - and each other - is actually a choice?\n\n==================================================================================\n\nThe same message is in countless movies, popular books, religion and philosophies, modern day therapy... I've even recently seen it in a children's animated cartoon somebody showed me called &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; (?) in it's last 3 episodes. It's all out there, scattered across mainstream culture.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nHere's a simple 2-step summary:\n\n1) Awareness that the suffering we 'experience' really comes from within us.\n2) Realization that we can alter our perspectives, our outlook on life itself.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nI just wanted to share some books that have helped me out. \n\nAfter 16 years of searching, I found a way out of chronic suicidal depression.\n\nI'm not trying to be preachy, just hoping to pass it on. None of these books in\n\nin particular (except the Tao) had something that crucially helped, but they all \n\nhold the same signposts.\n\n==================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e02f987be695a4515b7fbce7cfa500c88a264fd","amp;dn":"SPIRIT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e02f987be695a4515b7fbce7cfa500c88a264fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,2,249,135,190,105,90,69,21,183,251,206,124,250,80,12,136,162,100,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
