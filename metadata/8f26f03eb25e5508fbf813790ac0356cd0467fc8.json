One postwar spring the author met a tall man with stooping shoulders and big rugged hands. And perhaps for the first and last time soldier Andrei Sokolov told a chance acquaintance the story of his life, told how he endured tortures and sufferings that would have broken many a man of weaker nature... But Sokolov's torn and wounded heart is still eager for life and eager to share life with his little Vanya, orphaned by the war like himself. Sholokov's The Fate of a Man ends on a stern note. Yet as one closes the book one believes that Andrei Sokolov will give all the strength of his generous Russian soul to his adopted son and that the boy will grow at his father's side into another man who can overcome any obstacle if his country calls upon him to do so.\n\nMore info - http://www.sovlit.net/fateofaman/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f26f03eb25e5508fbf813790ac0356cd0467fc8","amp;dn":"Mikhail+Sholokhov+-+The+Fate+Of+A+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f26f03eb25e5508fbf813790ac0356cd0467fc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,38,240,62,178,94,85,8,251,248,19,121,10,192,53,108,208,70,127,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
