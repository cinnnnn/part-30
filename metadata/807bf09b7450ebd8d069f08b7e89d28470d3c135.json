From his childhood during America's Great Depression to the heady\ndays of the space programme, his historic first step on the Moon and his\nfamously private later life. Seen through the eyes of those who were with him\nthe film explores the man behind the myth, a man who was very much a product of\nhis time\n\nThe filmgoes beyond his days as an astronaut and shows that his life after the\nflight of Apollo 11 was, in many ways equally challenging, as Armstrong came to\nterms with life outside NASA and the relentless demands of fame until his death\nin August 2012\n\nFrom the producers of 'In the Shadow of the Moon'. Featuring interviews with\nArmstrong's first wife Janet, their two sons, Rick and Mark, Neil's brother and\nsister Dean and June, his best friend Kotcho Solacoff and second wife Carol\nFellow astronauts Mike Collins, Buzz Aldrin, Charlie Duke and Dave Scott also\nfeature in this revealing biopic\n\nEnjoy!\n\nGreetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS\n\nWe are currently looking for:\n* US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n* Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\nE-mail enquires to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ee8d8f9eda9a98ae89838f8782c08d8183&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:807bf09b7450ebd8d069f08b7e89d28470d3c135","amp;dn":"Neil+Armstrong+First+Man+On+The+Moon+720p+HDTV+x264-C4TV+%5BPublic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"807bf09b7450ebd8d069f08b7e89d28470d3c135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,123,240,155,116,80,235,216,208,105,240,139,126,137,210,132,112,211,193,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
