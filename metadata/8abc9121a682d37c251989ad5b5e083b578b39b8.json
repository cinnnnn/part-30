With a plot premise reminiscent of Martin Scorsese's After Hours, American art dealer Bennie (Miguel Sandoval) arrives in Liverpool and gets to his hotel with great difficulty, while British art dealer Frank King (Cox) has no such problem. Abandoned by the waiter in the hotel's restaurant, the two head out into the rainy Liverpool night but find mostly closed restaurants, eventually choosing a Greek restaurant where Bennie has an anxiety attack. They move on but find no satisfaction at a Chinese restaurant or a Japanese restaurant. Hunger pangs surface as they travel about via subway, bus, ferry and taxi. Eventually, they arrive in the middle of a desert where they meet another lost and hungry businessman, Leroy Jasper (Robert Wisdom). Shown at the 1998 Hamptons Film Festival.\n\n~~~~~~ Three Businessmen.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................733,962,240                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.0.1              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:17:15                \nFrame Count:....................................115855             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................352                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.727                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1118                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.209&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................136                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n---not my rip---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abc9121a682d37c251989ad5b5e083b578b39b8","amp;dn":"Alex+Cox+-+Three+Businessmen+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abc9121a682d37c251989ad5b5e083b578b39b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,188,145,33,166,130,211,124,37,25,137,173,91,94,8,59,87,139,57,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
