Another line, of the British branch of the family, was elevated by Queen Victoria, who granted two hereditary titles of Baronet (1847) and Baron which ennobled the family (1885).\n\nDuring the 19th century, when it was at its height, the Rothschild family is believed by some to have possessed the largest private fortune in the world, as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history.The family's wealth is believed to have subsequently declined, as it was divided amongst hundreds of descendants.Today, Rothschild businesses are far less well known than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including finance, real estate, mining, energy, mixed farming, wine, and charities.\n\n\n\nFrederic Morton The Rothschilds a Family Portrait 1962.pdf\t29.50 MB\n\nNiall Ferguson - The House of Rothschild; The World's Banker, 1849-1998 vol.2\t\n\nJohn Reeves - The Rothschild Financial Rulers of Nations 1887\t\n\nRavage Marcus Eli - Five men of Frankfort - story about Rothschild\t\n\nAndrew Carrington Hitchcock - Synagogue Of Satan - The secret history of Jewish world domination, with pics\t\n\nJunius__Grand_proces_entre_Rothschild_Ier_Roi_des_Juifs_et_Satan_dernier_roi_des_imposteurs\t\n\nNiall Ferguson - The House of Rothschild; The World's Banker, 1849-1998 vol.1\t\n\nEgon Caesar Corti - The Rise of the House of Rothschild 1770-1830, 1927\n\nArmstrong - Rothschild Money Trust (1940)\n\nColeman - The Rothschild Dynasty\n\nHollaenderski_Leon_-_Bar-Mitzwa_13me_anniversaire_d_Edmond_Baron_de_Rothschild\n\nLeon Hollaenderski - Bar-Mitzwa 13me anniversaire d Edmond Baron de Rothschild (1858, french)\n\nWorld governance map\n\nConingsby by Benjamin Disraeli ( Sidonia is Lionel de Rothschild )\n\nJohn - Behind the Balfour Declaration; Britain's Great War Pledge to Lord Rothschild (1983)\n\nArnold Leese - Gentile Folly - the Rothschilds, 1940\n\nSmith - The History of the House of Rothschild\n\nThe Rothschild Dynasty - Des Griffin\n\nPlan for world domination","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e90c5a0ed157bac44ae744ef3578f2f048eb8100","amp;dn":"The+Rothschild+family+ebook+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e90c5a0ed157bac44ae744ef3578f2f048eb8100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,12,90,14,209,87,186,196,74,231,68,239,53,120,242,240,72,235,129,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
