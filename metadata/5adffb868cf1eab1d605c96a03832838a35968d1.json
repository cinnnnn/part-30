If you work on computers a lot, then slow system and program starts, endless rendering and memory \n\nprocesses, or even system crashes when playing can quickly ruin your enjoyment. Defragmenting your PC can hugely \n\naccelerate the speed you can work on your PC. When you defragment, those files fragmented across the hard disk are \n\nlogically rearranged so that files can be quickly recognized and processed by the hardware. Performance gains of up to \n\n100% are not uncommon! In the new version of O&amp;O Defrag, you can now see what the program does for your system \n\nthanks to graphics and statistics, which give you a before-and-after Defrag contrast!\n\nNew and enhanced functions\n\nThe revised and improved algorithms for defragmentation mean that O&amp;O Defrag 16 packs stored file fragments even \n\nfaster together, and support for defragmentation of locked files under O&amp;O Defrag 16 is better than ever before. The SSD \n\nOptimization by TRIM has also been enhanced and now supports even more manufacturers.\nPerformance increases of up to 100%\n\nA continuous sorting of files on hard disks means they can be read quicker by Windows, which in turn accelerates all the \n\nread and write accesses by up to 100%.\nShorter defragmentation times and faster system and program starts\n\nWith O&amp;O Defrag 16, several drives can be defragmented simultaneously. In addition, the algorithms have been \n\nsubstantially accelerated, reducing the time required for a defragmentation by up to 40%. By using O&amp;O Defrag, files can \n\nbe read and written much more quickly. What at first seems to be lost performance can easily be rediscovered and realized \n\nagain with O&amp;O Defrag, giving you the peace of mind that your hardware is in good health and operating optimally.\nAutomatic defragmentation in the background\n\nO&amp;O Defrag works quietly in the background so that the defragmentation process does not disturb other tasks and has no \n\nnegative performance impact on your systems.\n\nChanges in 17.0.476:\nOn Windows 8, the user may be wrongly warned about missing TRIM compatibility of some specific SSDs\n\nInstall Notes :-\n\n1.
