Considering that this Ottawa musician had only began playing guitar a couple months before his first performance, the fact that he has been compared with the likes of Bright Eyes is really astounding. (The Uniter) ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to say though that this comparison is untrue or an exaggeration, because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not. Giant Hand has a similar sound, with the raw vocals and poetic lyrics, however his sound is his own.\n\nGiant Hand released his first full length album Coming Home back in 2009. on March 15, he released his second EP entitled Starting As People that lived up to and exceeded expectations. The six-track album is about 20 minutes long in total, however it seems as if it lasts only a fraction of that time. Each song flows smoothly into the next, with a near-perfect mix of delicate percussion, guitar, even some other strings and spellbinding vocals and lyrics.\n\ncd ripped by  X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/16/giant-hand/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49cd0789de116a45612f3aac3028c922ce5bd977","amp;dn":"Giant+Hand...Starting+As+People%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49cd0789de116a45612f3aac3028c922ce5bd977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,205,7,137,222,17,106,69,97,47,58,172,48,40,201,34,206,91,217,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
