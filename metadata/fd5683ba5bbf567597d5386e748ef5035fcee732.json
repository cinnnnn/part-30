Whats new? This release is now able to jailbreak the new iPhone 3GS. I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been able to confirm it but iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard the dev team also updated ultrasn0w, the iPhone OS 3.0 unlocking to work with the 3GS. While this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the first jailbreak for the 3GS, it is way more stable and safer than the other method.I used it on my sisters 3gs and worked a charm - Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5683ba5bbf567597d5386e748ef5035fcee732","amp;dn":"Redsn0w+0.8+%28iPhone+3GS+Jailbreak%29Tested-Stable%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5683ba5bbf567597d5386e748ef5035fcee732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,86,131,186,91,191,86,117,151,213,56,110,116,142,245,3,95,206,231,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
