The song is the band's thirty-fifth single, and is also the second single from the album, released on 14 November 2006 in the United States, and 26 December 2006 in Europe. The song has been stated by the band to be a tribute to Thin Lizzy due to the low sounding melodies sung by Bruce Dickinson that are reminiscent of those Phil Lynott would sing. It was played first every night on the band's A Matter of Life and Death Tour.\n\nThe guitar solo in &quot;Different World&quot; is played by Adrian Smith.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Different World&quot; (Adrian Smith, Steve Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (Live - 10 November 2006) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:40\n    &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name (Radio 1 'Legends' Session)&quot; (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:13\n    &quot;The Trooper (Radio 1 'Legends' Session)&quot; (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa484d91dbca62c2f097be6c9c6955a6c539d456","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Different+World+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa484d91dbca62c2f097be6c9c6955a6c539d456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,72,77,145,219,202,98,194,240,151,190,108,156,105,85,166,197,57,212,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
