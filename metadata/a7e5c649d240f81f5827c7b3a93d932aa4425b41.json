Fly from space to your neighborhood. Type in an address and zoom right in. Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions. Tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings. Save and share your searches and favorites. Even add your own annotations.\n\nGoogle Earth lets you do smooth sailing flybyes of the entire Earth. You can easily fly to any spot on the globe, by entering any associated data, like street addresses, place names or lat/long coordinates. There are overlays that put additional information on the map, like roads, international boundaries, terrain, 3D buildings, crime statistics, schools, stadiums, any number of interesting stuff. You can do Local searches in the program, with icons on the map and a display on the side showing your results.\n\nYou can leave notes, called &quot;placemarks&quot; all over the map, so you can remember where all sorts of places are. Searches and placemarks can be saved as bookmarks in &quot;My Places&quot;. Everything can be output in an XML format called KML, that will allow the vast popularity of Google Maps to continue in Earth. You can also email a JPEG of the map, or send a KMZ file if you know the recipient has Earth installed.\n\nFeatures:\n- Sophisticated streaming technology delivers the data to you as you need it.\n- Imagery and 3D data depict the entire earth - Terabytes of aerial and satellite imagery depict cities around the world in high-resolution detail.\n- Local search lets you search for restaurants, hotels, and even driving directions. Results show in your 3D earth view. Easy to layer multiple searches, save results to folders, and share with others.\n- Layers show parks, schools, hospitals, airports, retail, and more.\n- Overlays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ import site plans, design sketches and even scanned blueprints.\n- Annotate the view with lines and polygons.\n- Spreadsheet import - ingest up to 2,500 locations by address or lat/lon.\n- KML ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ data exchange format let your share useful annotations.\n\nUse it for:\n- Planning a trip\n- Getting driving directions\n- Finding a house or apartment\n- Finding a local business\n- Exploring the world\n\nRecommended configuration:\n- Operating system: Windows 2000/ XP/ Vista\n- CPU speed: IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® P4 2.4GHz+ or AMD 2400xp+\n- System memory (RAM): 512MB\n- 2GB hard-disk space\n- 3D graphics card: 3D-capable video card with 32MB VRAM or greater\n- 1280x1024, 32-bit true color screen\n- Network speed: 128 kbps (&quot;Broadband/Cable Internet&quot;)\n\n\nMore AT: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n\n\n\n88888888888 888                                                       \n    888     888                                                       \n    888     888                                                       \n    888     88888b.  888  888 88888b.d88b.  88888b.   .d88b.  888d888\n    888     888 &quot;88b 888  888 888 &quot;888 &quot;88b 888 &quot;88b d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;   \n    888     888  888 888  888 888  888  888 888  888 88888888 888     \n    888     888  888 Y88b 888 888  888  888 888 d88P Y8b.     888     \n    888     888  888  &quot;Y88888 888  888  888 88888P&quot;   &quot;Y8888  888 \n                                            88\n                                            88\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7e5c649d240f81f5827c7b3a93d932aa4425b41","amp;dn":"Google+Earth+Plus+v6.0.0.1735+incl+Patch++BY+Thumper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7e5c649d240f81f5827c7b3a93d932aa4425b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,229,198,73,210,64,248,31,88,39,199,179,169,61,147,42,164,66,91,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
