He urgently needs to lose weight before his obesity kills him. But Ricky and wife Cheryl live in the Pacific Ocean on the island of Guam where there is no obesity surgery that might save his life. This is the story of the struggle and ultimately tragic failure to save Ricky. In a desperate effort to get help Ricky appeals to campaigner Angie Flores, herself a former weight loss surgery patient, who lives 10,000 miles away in Texas. Angie calls in first an American, then an Australian, surgeon who travel to Guam to meet Ricky and Cheryl. Both give Ricky an ultimatum - lose weight or the surgery can never happen. Over a three year period the film follows the dramatic highs and lows as Ricky pursues his dream to have surgery and lose weight.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;145c7d737c5458273a24&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2010 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 688 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\n * Release Notes\n * Merged subtitles\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.electricsky.com/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=3094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.electricsky.com/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=3094&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e2342640bdeb311f91df89a6cea227ea7634fad","amp;dn":"Ch5+The+Man+Who+Ate+Himself+to+Death+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e2342640bdeb311f91df89a6cea227ea7634fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,35,66,100,11,222,179,17,249,29,248,154,108,234,34,126,167,99,79,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
