Selznick\nDirected by Vittorio De Sica\nStarring: Jennifer Jones, Montgomery Clift\n\nscreens at: http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/3699/indiscretions.jpg\n\nA notoriously troubled bit of celluloid history, with a multitude of script doctors, producer snits, and (potential) marital strife between Jones and Selznick... both a dated melodrama and modern character study, it's a reflection of what happens when 50s American and Italian film styles are melded... here's the scoop from the Roan DVD description:\n\n&quot;A collaboration between producer David O. Selznick and Italian director Vittorio De Sica (The Bicycle Thief) could only end up an interesting movie. And that's just what happened with Indiscretion of an American Wife (1954).\n\nJennifer Jones, married to Selznick at the time, is an American wife on holiday in Rome; Montgomery Clift is her Italian lover. She bids him farewell at the train station, he begs her to stay. That forms the basis of a very well-acted character study.\n\nWhile the plot's simplicity itself, production was not. A trainload of writers toiled on the script, some with no credit: Truman Capote, Carson McCullers, Paul Gallico, and Alberto Moravia, among others. De Sica spoke no English. Selznick hated the original title, Terminal Station, and had it changed. And it's rumored that Jones had an interest in Clift that he didn't return. It's a wonder the movie was finished at all. And it is quite a testament to Jones and Clift that they gave such strong performances.\n\nStars and subject matter produced a money-maker. And the picture's costume design, by Christian Dior, was nominated for an Oscar.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b653d5c1387525f6ed94393d8b913422266a6e96","amp;dn":"Indiscretion+of+an+American+Wife+%281954%2C+drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b653d5c1387525f6ed94393d8b913422266a6e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,83,213,193,56,117,37,246,237,148,57,61,139,145,52,34,38,106,110,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
