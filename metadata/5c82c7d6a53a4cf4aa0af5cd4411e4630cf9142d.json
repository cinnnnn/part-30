New introduction by Sue Hubbell.\n\nAbout the Author\nRachel Carson (1907-1964) spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the late 1950s, she had written three lyrical, popular books about the sea, including the best-selling The Sea Around Us, and had become the most respected science writer in America. She completed Silent Spring against formidable personal odds, and with it shaped a powerful social movement that has altered the course of history.\nSue Hubbell is the author of, among other works, A Country Year and A Book of Bees, which was selected as a New York Times Notable Book. She lives in Maine and Washington, D.C.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c82c7d6a53a4cf4aa0af5cd4411e4630cf9142d","amp;dn":"The+Edge+of+the+Sea+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c82c7d6a53a4cf4aa0af5cd4411e4630cf9142d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,130,199,214,165,58,76,244,170,10,245,205,68,17,228,99,12,249,20,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
