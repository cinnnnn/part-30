Savannah and  Cooper, a young couple  in love,\n        drive through the desert in a black 70s Cadillac  convertible.\n        Unaware that they are being followed, they check into a  motel\n        at the Mexican border. When Savannah leaves to buy food, a cop\n        sneaks into the room, pulls his gun on Cooper, accuses him  of\n        murder and tries to arrest  him. But Savannah, who had  become\n        suspicious, manages to turn the tables: She surprises the cop,\n        ties him  up and  frees Cooper.  But just  as the young lovers\n        jump into their car, a  stranger steps out of the  shadows and\n        kills Cooper at point  blank... \n        \n        Three weeks  later. Hollywood,  California. In  a hotel  suite\n        overlooking the Sunset Strip, a  man is being water boarded by\n        a private detective. The information he needs is: &quot;Who  killed\n        Babyface?&quot; When the man refuses to cooperate and shows nothing\n        but contempt for his  captor, the torture continues.  Layer by\n        layer the truth about Cooper alias Babyface is revealed.\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n\n                 David Carradine     ....
