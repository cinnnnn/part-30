There are, as usual for\n    King, no notes or session information and no information on the year\n    of release of any of the songs. The audio quality on the 1988\n    remastering leaves something to be desired -- the sonics on some of\n    it are a bit compressed, but there may not be much that can be done\n    about this, as some of the stuff goes back to the mid-'40s, and the\n    producers have at least had the courage to pump the volume up high,\n    so the guitars are nice and loud (check &quot;Rattlesnakin' Daddy&quot;).\n\n    -- Bruce Eder\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5910cf5525609b3f01b5f088ab7f436b4965df61","amp;dn":"Hawkshaw+Hawkins+-+Hawkshaw+Hawkins+vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5910cf5525609b3f01b5f088ab7f436b4965df61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,16,207,85,37,96,155,63,1,181,240,136,171,127,67,107,73,101,223,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
