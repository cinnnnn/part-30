That represents an\nastonishing diversity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nearly 25 times more words than there are individual stars\nvisible to the naked eye in the night sky. And even 50,000 seems insignificant\nbeside the half a million recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. But looked at\nfrom an historical perspective, that diversity becomes more apparent than real.\nTracing a wordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development back in time shows that in many cases what are now\nseparate lexical terms were formerly one and the same word. The deep prehistory of\nour language has nurtured little word-seeds that over the millennia have\nproliferated into widely differentiated families of vocabulary.\nThe purpose of this book is to uncover the often surprising connections between\nelements of the English lexicon that have become obscured by centuries of\nlanguage change Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the links in our word-web that join such unlikely partners as, for\ninstance, beef and cow, bacteria and imbecile, and bishop and spy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57275c06d70fb1dccffaf94cdc9bd7edcbbd27da","amp;dn":"Word+Origins%2C2nd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57275c06d70fb1dccffaf94cdc9bd7edcbbd27da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,39,92,6,215,15,177,220,207,250,249,76,220,155,215,237,203,189,39,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
