AVRO's &quot;TopPop&quot; was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988. \n\n&quot;TopPop&quot; was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead. \n\n&quot;Rock the Boat&quot; is a disco song by the group Hues Corporation in 1974. It is sometimes considered the first disco record to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, though some consider this distinction to go to &quot;Love's Theme&quot; by Love Unlimited Orchestra (earlier that same year) or even The Sound Of Philadelphia (TSOP) by MFSB. &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; was written by Waldo Holmes, who also wrote the Blacula songs.\n\nInitially, &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; appeared as though it would flop, as months went by without any radio airplay or sales activity. Not until the song became a disco/club favorite in New York did Top 40 radio finally pick up on the song, leading the record to finally enter the Hot 100 and zip up the chart to #1 in July 1974. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_the_Boat_(Hues_Corporation_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_the_Boat_(Hues_Corporation_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAalkaadL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAalkaadL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 768x576 25.00fps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:34\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

Their video quality may not be as good, or their resolution may be odd, and so on. For example, the original file for this video had a odd resolution of 352x576. The Media Player Classic played it at the correct aspect ratio of 768x576 (4:3) just fine, but takes the screenshots at the original odd resolution, so i had converted them to .mkv to get a correct screenshot to use when i posted it, but decided to post the .mkv conversions since the &quot;DivX Plus Converter&quot; allowed me to pass through the original AC3 audio and the video is about the same quality. Hope you enjoy them also :) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6fd8d1ed31a6234129aae43b33fbfa890c1c7f2","amp;dn":"Hues+Corporation+-+Rock+the+Boat+%5BTopPop+1974%5D+VHS.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6fd8d1ed31a6234129aae43b33fbfa890c1c7f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,253,141,30,211,26,98,52,18,154,174,67,179,63,191,168,144,193,199,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
