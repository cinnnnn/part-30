It runs in the system tray and allows user to control the native firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista.\n\nWindows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:\nNo Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.\nHigh Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All outgoing connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.\nMedium Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outgoing connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only programs you allow can initiate outgoing connections.\nLow Filtering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Outgoing connections that do not match a rule are allowed. You can block the programs you do not want to initiate outgoing connections.\n\nProgram Features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Just one small executable file. All features are packed in the same file.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full support for executing tasks from standard user accounts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intuitive and easy accessible interface in the system tray.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Allow or block a program to connect to the internet with just one mouse click.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shell integration into the right click context menu of the executable files.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Search for invalid rules with the possibility to delete them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Quick access to edit Windows Firewall rules directly from the program interface.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Choose if you want the program to start at user logon.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Import and export the policy of the program.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Protection to unauthorized uninstallation.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Possibility to restore previous settings at uninstallation.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Check for a new version from the program interface.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ And many moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Just give it a try.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Learning Mode which provides notifications for blocked outgoing connections.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Search for executable files in a user defined folder and create new rules for the selected ones from the result list.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.0\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Compatible with all 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista.\n\nChanges in 3.9.0.5:\nNew: The notification window position is now saved on window closing and restored on the next reopening.\nFixed: Program crashes if the user chooses to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open file locationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Manage Rules window for a connection generated by System.\nFixed: When the Rules tab is set to create Ã¢â‚¬Å“Outbound and inbound rulesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the description of the inbound rule contains Ã¢â‚¬Å“OutboundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instead of Ã¢â‚¬Å“InboundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nImproved: The service loading time was reduced with 90% by using a different mechanism of reading of the initial set of data.\nImproved: The program can now reconnect to the service in case the communication channel gets in faulted state, without needing to restart the program.\nImproved: Various parts of the code were improved to increase the execution speed of the program.\n\nInstall Note:\n1.
