Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Dave Smith, Jim Norton\r\n\r\nEpisode 242 Wednesdayâ€™s TACS starts with Anthony explaining his star-studded afternoon and while we wait for Jim Norton to join the show, â€œspecial guestâ€ Dave Smith sits in to defend his last appearance, talk about menâ€™s magazines, feminism, men shaming, slut shaming, and Dave then gets the ol' boot so Jimmy â€œI gotta peeâ€ Norton can take a seat. Jimmy and Ant discuss a video from Milo at the â€œslut walkâ€ rally, refugees, depression, and then jump right into the Jocktober weâ€™ve all been waiting for, Terry Clifford. Ant reads an e-mail from yesterdayâ€™s Jocktober â€œvictimsâ€ Dana and Jayson, the guys talk about Bubba the Love Sponge, Mike Caltaâ€™s hate for Bubba, X-Pacâ€™s follicles, Jimmyâ€™s follicles, Jimmyâ€™s pussy eating in high school, and a new desk for TACS. (LOL thatâ€™s never happening, is it?) Ant reads about Muzzie Day at Six Flags, they discuss the division of America, Regular Joe shuts shit down, the guys talk about music and TV habits changing, changes at Comic-Con, the gastric sleeve, the MMA fighter who shit himself, â€œThe Brady Bunch Hour,â€ Jimmyâ€™s upcoming gigs, apartment issues, they kvetch about their love life, and we get teased about an upcoming Chip animation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: https://kat.cr/user/mothergoose58/uploads/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b243da9e0b2d8064bcf48c2a6292df5719f70e32","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-07+Jim+Norton+Dave+Smith+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b243da9e0b2d8064bcf48c2a6292df5719f70e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,67,218,158,11,45,128,100,188,244,140,42,98,146,223,87,25,247,14,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
