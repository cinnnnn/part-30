The first (1642Ã¢â‚¬â€œ46) and second (1648Ã¢â‚¬â€œ49) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649Ã¢â‚¬â€œ51) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son, Charles II, and replacement of English monarchy with, first, the Commonwealth of England (1649Ã¢â‚¬â€œ53), and then with a Protectorate (1653Ã¢â‚¬â€œ59), under Oliver Cromwell's personal rule. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although this concept was legally established only with the Glorious Revolution later in the century.\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\n1 - CROMWELL (the 1970 film featuring Alec Guiness and Richard Harris)\n\n2 - Cromwell - God's Executioner (2-part History Channel documentary)\n\n3 - Greatest Britons (Cromwell came in 10th in the survey)\n\n4 - Monarchy no. 11 - Cromwell the King Killer\n\n5 - The English Civil War (3-part BBC documentary series)\n\n6 - All relevant OSPREY battle books relating to the period\n\n7 - The Monty Python song OLIVER CROMWELL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db14329125ee7da68b0760c340e59727466f4fb2","amp;dn":"The+English+Civil+War+%281642%26ndash%3B1651%29+Educational+Resource","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db14329125ee7da68b0760c340e59727466f4fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,20,50,145,37,238,125,166,139,7,96,195,64,229,151,39,70,111,79,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
