In 1992 he finally had the chance to make his recording debut as a leader. On this CD he shows where his son gained his inspiration from, for the elder DeFrancesco is an excellent player. He is a little more laid-back than Joey, but swings hard. For the set, Papa John jams on five standards, sings &quot;Do You Want to Dance,&quot; and romps on his son's &quot;Blues for L.D.&quot; Speaking of Joey, he switches to trumpet for his dad's date, while his brother, Johnny DeFrancesco Jr., plays guitar on half of the selections; also featured are tenor saxophonist Bill Easley, guitarist Randy Johnston, and drummer Byron Landham. This out-of-print CD is easily recommended to fans of soul-jazz organists.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5646b43686ee83332d7cfa2f6417b533d883d01f","amp;dn":"Papa+John+DeFrancesco+-+Doodlin%27+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5646b43686ee83332d7cfa2f6417b533d883d01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,70,180,54,134,238,131,51,45,124,250,47,100,23,181,51,216,131,208,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
