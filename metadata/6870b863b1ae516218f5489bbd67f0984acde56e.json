Determined to get revenge on Mumm-Ra, \nLion-O sets out for the Sea of Sands with a relunctant Cheetara and Tygra in tow. \nAs they leave Thundera, Wiley Kit and Wiley Kat approach the trio, asking to \njoin in the journey until they find El Dara. Lion-O refuses, but the twins follow anyway. \nThey reach the desert like ocean, but are captured by a group of Fish people called the Koi. \nTheir leader is obsessed with tracking down and killing a creature called Ramlak, which \nsucked up the waters of the Koi's homeland. Lion-O begins to succumb to his own obsession, \nhelping the captain's goal despite the protests of Tygra and Cheetara alike. \nEventually the Ramlak snags the ship with it's tentacles and tears it to pieces, \nforcing Lion-O to forgot his obession and save everyone from drowning, the captain \ndying as he makes one final strike at Ramlak. Once everyone is safe, Lion-O is seemingly \ndevoured by Ramlak, only to cut his way out with the Sword of Omens, releasing the \nstolen waters from it's body. With their home restored, the Koi bid the group farewell, \nLion-O accepting the twins after seeing their capability in battle. At Mumm-Ra's black pyramid, \nit is revealed that Jaga is still alive, but now a prisoner of a lantern which Mumm-Ra claims \nwill lead him to the Book of Omens \n\nSeries Cast\n-------------\n Clancy Brown ...
