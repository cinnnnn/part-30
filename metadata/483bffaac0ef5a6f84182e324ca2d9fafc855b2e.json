I organized the previously rough material in a book thinking it\nmight be beneficial. I took on the effort of producing many copies voluntarily,\nprinting in both Tibetan and Mongolian languages, keeping the image of my lama in\nmy mind. Mipham Shenyen acted as a secretary for three years. During that period I\nsuffered due to severe conditions such as disputes and curses and was not able to\nrepay the kindness. When the woodblocks were engraved, on the eighth day of the\nmonth of Sakadawa, during the Earth-Tiger year, the venerable Nawang Losang\nnewly spread the banner of victory of the teachings.\nI, bikshu Nawang Pelden with virtuous aspiration and enthusiasm, tolerant and openminded,\ncommitted this noble text to paper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483bffaac0ef5a6f84182e324ca2d9fafc855b2e","amp;dn":"Commentary+on+the+%5C%27King+of+Prayers%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483bffaac0ef5a6f84182e324ca2d9fafc855b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,59,255,170,192,239,90,111,132,24,46,50,76,162,217,250,252,133,91,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
