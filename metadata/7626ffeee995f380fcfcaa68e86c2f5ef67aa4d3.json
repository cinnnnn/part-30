He must restore the Runes of Virtue, cleanse the shrines of the Guardian&amp;#039;s taint and restore the people to the way of the Virtues ? now knowing that he will never again be able to return to Earth.\n\nUltima IX was controversial in that it deviated from most of the previous Ultimas&amp;#039; isometric view and party-based gameplay. It sold poorly, and was ill-received by many fans, creating sufficient outcry that Origin shut down an official online help page due to so many negative posts. Ultimately, Richard Garriott left Electronic Arts over &quot;creative differences&quot;, thus effectively ending the series. EA retains the rights to the Ultima brand.\n\nA MMORPG sequel of sorts, Ultima X: Odyssey, began development at EA ? but to the further dismay of Ultima fans it was cancelled in 2004, before completion. It was to be set in a world named Alucinor, created by the Avatar following the events of Ultima IX.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a rare and great RPG game that is hard to find, so grab it while it&amp;#039;s still hot!!
