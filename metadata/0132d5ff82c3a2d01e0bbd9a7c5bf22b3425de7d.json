The group performs repertoire from both folk and classical genres at a frantic pace and with humorous attitude, sometimes reminiscent of cartoon soundtracks.\nThe group was formed in 1986, playing first in Soviet state-sponsored competitions. They had their first paying jobs in 1987. Their first international touring began in 1988 in support of baritone singer Vladimir Chemov. After Chemov was sidelined by illness in 1989, Terem began solo concert tours. In 1991, they met Peter Gabriel at the WOMAD festival. Gabriel helped the group to reach a wider audience in the western world by releasing their albums Terem and Classical on his label, Real World Records.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
