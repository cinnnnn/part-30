Parkin brings critical issues to the forefront. Each chapter begins with one of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s key issues, and additional issues appear throughout the chapter to show the real-world applications of the theory being discussed. When the chapter concludes, students ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œread between the linesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to think critically about a news article relating to the issue, demonstrating how thinking like an economist helps make informed decisions. \n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMichael Parkin is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Economics at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.
