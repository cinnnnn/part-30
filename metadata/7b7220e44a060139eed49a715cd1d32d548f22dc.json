The group manages to balance out a mixture of bright, acoustic shimmers of guitar with more forceful electric leads and a handful of singalong harmonies. Occasionally, they end up with a poppy, slightly off-kilter pop song like &quot;Hosanna in the Highest&quot; -- which sounds like a teenage Buffalo Tom. The recording of the album is another highlight -- the way the bells chime or the acoustic guitars flicker. A track like &quot;One Version of Events&quot; is a basic chunky punk-pop song with thick, quavering leads, but it comes to life in the recording and multi-tracking. &quot;Deadship, Darkship,&quot; with its harmony-led chorus and cathartic screech, manages to deliver tension tenfold -- not to mention by throwing in an arena-ready singalong. Elsewhere in the album, moments of presumed predictability are given new light by quick changes and smart melodies. For every minute of tinny, wishful, bleary-eyed angst, there's a rallying cry ÃƒÂ  la Superchunk. It may not be the most distinctive of releases, but it manages to formulate the sounds of what could be an interesting trajectory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7220e44a060139eed49a715cd1d32d548f22dc","amp;dn":"Sorry+About+Dresden+-+The+Convenience+of+Indecision+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7220e44a060139eed49a715cd1d32d548f22dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,114,32,228,74,6,1,57,238,212,154,113,92,209,211,45,84,143,34,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
