With Fevers and Mirrors being their third full-length release, a strong adaptation of Radiohead, Blur, and Suede is conveniently wrapped up in a neat lo-fi package. But without completely ripping anyone off, Bright Eyes feature their own cadence of loose indie and shaky, emotional vocals. The results amount to a catchy collection of elaborate pop that's been perfectly captured on a nickel budget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2cac002c405aaf61c2c7037fb9e7535e1b680c1","amp;dn":"Bright+Eyes+-+Fevers+and+Mirrors+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2cac002c405aaf61c2c7037fb9e7535e1b680c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,202,192,2,196,5,170,246,28,44,112,55,251,158,117,53,225,182,128,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
