Wishing\n\nBunny Gets Paid catches Red Red Meat three-quarters of the way through its deconstruction of blues rock, its tempos slowed, its textures murkier and more ruminative than on Jimmywine Majestic, its temperature much cooler than the hard-kicking, slide-stinging roots rock of, say, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmokey Mountain Double Dip.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Instead, Bunny pursues a gritty, world-weary, wandering sort of aesthetic, song structure subordinated to slow-moving sonic exploration. Red Red Meat fans argue about whether Bunny Gets Paid represents an advance or retreat from Jimmywine, and the answer seems to depend on how badly you want Red Red Meats songs to be songs, rather than fever dreams, filmic landscapes or hallucinations.\n\nConsider how the album starts on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarpet of Horses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with a series of slow blues chords that ebb and recede, a solitary bent note ending each phrase, hanging on endlessly after itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s struck. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more like a warm up than an introduction, hesitantly sketching mood but not giving away any melody. RutiliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, when it comes, is similarly hushed, pocked with silences, tentative, buried even here under the barest mesh of sounds. The song builds at a glacial pace, taking shape from a confluence of murmurs, chords and rhythms, until it fully inhabits its space. The reissueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alternate version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarpet of Horses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ call the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCleverslyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version, is, in many ways more accessible, faster by a slight margin, and anchored by the hard distortion of bass, the booming kick of drums. It turns into a recognizable song almost immediately, while the album version coalesces only gradually out of wreathes of smoke. The alternate shows that Red Red Meat could have made a fairly conventional song out of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarpet of Horses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but elected not to. Obscurity over clarity, evocation over description, texture over narrative, Bunny Gets Paid makes the difficult choice every time.\n\nThese difficulties extend notably to the production. The album, even in its remastered iteration, is crusted over with dirt and static. Non-musical sounds like someone coughing (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarpet of HorseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), a phone ringing (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGauzeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and the low hum of idle amplifiers (everywhere) are allowed to flourish in the margins. The microphones often seem to be focused on the wrong things, forcing you to hear incidental sounds up front, while obscuring melody-carrying elements like guitar or voice. And silence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or at least the sound of a room with no one playing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is the unacknowledged sixth member of Red Red Meat. These songs are full of negative space, not quiet exactly, but the interstices between musical ideas.\n\nThe remastered, repackaged reissue includes a second bonus disc of material ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a 4-track demo of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChain Chain Chain,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the alternate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarpet of Horses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the single version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIdiot SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and some cuts that may be wholly new, even to long-time fans. A cover of LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is eerily predictive of SparhawkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later, electrified approach on albums like The Great Destroyer and last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Retribution Gospel Choir. A closing version of Flock of Seagulls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWishing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ crusted with distortion and sung in a whiskey croak, unexpectedly coaxes vulnerability and soul out of a new wave chestnut. (Rutili has always had a penchant for imbuing silly, commercially-successful songs with heart. The original Bunny Gets Paid ends with a quite affecting take on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Always TomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from the clay-mation Rudolph the Red Nosed Raindeer, and he once sang a whole verse of CherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBelieveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to me on the phone during an interview, surreal but much more interesting than the original.) The big find, though is the previously unreleased ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSt. AnthonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jawbone,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a sweaty, swaggering hulk of a blues-rock song, with blaring, funk saxophones bursting from its overstuffed seams.\n\nThe additional materials only confirm what the maddening, difficult and ultimately wonderful body of Bunny Gets Paid suggests. None of the songs are immediately obvious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“even the live-sounding, country-raver ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRosewood, Stax, Volts and GlitterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is hidden behind a screen of echo and distortion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and, as a result, all reward repeat listening. I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be surprised if no one simply likes this album. It either changes your life or leaves you cold.\n\nBy Jennifer Kelly\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:627b471d950e6dd7cc81802111da6677047a7aad","amp;dn":"Red_Red_Meat-Bunny_Gets_Paid-%28Remastered%29-2CD-2009-KzT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"627b471d950e6dd7cc81802111da6677047a7aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,123,71,29,149,14,109,215,204,129,128,33,17,218,102,119,4,122,122,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
