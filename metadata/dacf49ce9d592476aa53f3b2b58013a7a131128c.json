The VPN Client on a remote PC, communicating with a\n  Cisco Easy VPN server on an enterprise network or with a service provider,\n  creates a secure connection over the Internet. Through this connection you\n  can access a private network as if you were an on-site user. Thus you have\n  a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The server verifies that incoming\n  connections have up-to-date policies in place before establishing them.\n  Cisco IOS, VPN 3000 Series Concentrators, and PIX central-site servers can\n  all terminate VPN connections from VPN Clients. As a remote user (low speed\n  or high speed), you first connect to the Internet. Then you use the VPN\n  Client to securely access private enterprise networks through a Cisco VPN\n  server that supports the VPN client.\n\n\n***Installation Instructions***\n\nUnpack and Install","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dacf49ce9d592476aa53f3b2b58013a7a131128c","amp;dn":"Cisco.VPN.5.0.gReNdEl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dacf49ce9d592476aa53f3b2b58013a7a131128c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,207,73,206,157,89,36,118,170,83,243,178,181,128,19,167,161,49,18,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
