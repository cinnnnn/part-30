(I really liked this one, actually. I don't have kids, but I have a nine year old nephew and this is exactly the way his brain works.) I realize books like this aren't what I usually upload, but I think they're important because we need kids to get into comics again.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5ac5cd4f76e0a004de462d532fe566cf62abe2","amp;dn":"The+Lava+is+a+Floor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5ac5cd4f76e0a004de462d532fe566cf62abe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,90,197,205,79,118,224,160,4,222,70,45,83,47,229,102,207,98,171,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
