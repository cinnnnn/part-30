Also, been very annoyed Season 4, 5 and 6 were never released on DVD and probably never will be (licensing issues, contractual issues with appearing guest stars...and Sony sucks).\n\nThe copies floating around - mostly Lifetime TV captures - are ridiculously bad in quality and out of order.\n\nLately I stumbled across a much higher quality rip from a Bulgarian group shown on bcomedy in Bulgaria. But of course, no english audio. Well, actually, English audio but Bulgarian recorded over it, not in a separate channel or file, no, just straight over it. They should be shot for this.\nI also found by chance, a not quite as good copy from Russia, and yay, English and Russian in separate audio channels.\n\nI used the DVB quality (better than anything around, as close as you'll ever get to DVD quality for those seasons) Bulgarian Video and combined it with the Russian English audio.\nThis was a lot of work, about 3 weeks, since different channels cut out pieces and blend in ads wherever they damn please, so synching it up was a piece of work.\n\nSpecs below, I tested the files on all of my TVs (via USB, WD TV extender and streamed directly), the iPad, iPhone and my computers and they work fine. I do however recommend that you download a couple of eps to try for yourself before you give the whole seasons a go.\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                                : 234676667786622194780830661710230774152 (0xB08D150959B98640AA04C67B9EC2E188)\nComplete name                            : G:__TIXATIThe.Nanny.s06.DVBthe.nanny.s06e01.dvbrip.recut.avc-phen.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size                                : 328 MiB\nDuration                                 : 23mn 1s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 990 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2014-06-01 18:41:37\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v6.9.1 ('Blue Panther') 64bit built on Apr 18 2014 18:23:38\nWriting library                          : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7a371b13143a3649544a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 1 frame\nFormat settings, GOP                     : M=1, N=24\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 23mn 1s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nNominal bit rate                         : 2 000 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 704 pixels\nHeight                                   : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.215\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 23mn 1s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nSeason 6 has a lot of Recut episodes. That means, I had to cut out scenes from the Lifetime airing because there was no audio available or the other way around. It's not having an impact on the eps per se, it's just a little sad that some jokes had to go because of greedy ad-focused stations or moral differences in eastern European countries. Still, it's all good.\nThose eps have been encoded using AVC, not XviD, and are slightly larger in size.\nAlso, all eps should be in-sync (audio/video) most of the times. But as mentioned, it wasnt easy and there can be parts, where sync is not perfect but usually it's within the milliseconds range.\nEnd credits almost never have audio or the appropriate music because of early cut-outs of some stations.\nFran's last address to the audience in the show's finale is not sync and missing some audio. Couldnt be bothered to fix this too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edeb2b5d765f8c9f0a16689c3851df3c826ccec6","amp;dn":"The+Nanny+Season+6+DVB+%28high+quality%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edeb2b5d765f8c9f0a16689c3851df3c826ccec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,235,43,93,118,95,140,159,10,22,104,156,56,81,223,60,130,108,206,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
