Heat, passion, and controversy explode as a woman is forced to decide between romance and tradition.\n\nEvery young Indian leaving the homeland for the United States is given the following orders by their parents: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t eat any cow (ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still sacred!), donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go out too much, save (and save, and save) your money, and most important, do not marry a foreigner. Priya Rao left India when she was twenty to study in the U.S., and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been back. Now, seven years later, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out of excuses. She has to return and give her family the news: SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engaged to Nick Collins, a kind, loving American man. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to break their hearts.\n\nReturning to India is an overwhelming experience for Priya. When she was growing up, summer was all about mangoesÃ¢â‚¬â€ripe, sweet mangoes, bursting with juices that dripped down your chin, hands, and neck. But after years away, she sweats as if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been through an Indian summer before. Everything looks dirtier than she remembered. And things that used to seem natural (a buffalo strolling down a newly laid asphalt road, for example) now feel totally chaotic.\n\nBut PriyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relatives remain the same. Her mother and father insist that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time they arranged her marriage to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“nice Indian boy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Her extended family talks of nothing but marriageÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly the marriage of her uncle Anand, which still has them reeling. Not only did Anand marry a woman from another Indian state, but he also married for love. Happiness and love are not the point of her grandparentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ union. In her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule book, duty is at the top of the list.\n\nJust as Priya begins to feel she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t possibly tell her family that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engaged to an American, a secret is revealed that leaves her stunned and off-balance. Now she is forced to choose between the love of her family and Nick, the love of her life.\n\nAs sharp and intoxicating as sugarcane juice bought fresh from a market cart, The Mango Season is a delightful trip into the heart and soul of both contemporary India and a woman on the edge of a profound life change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc144b763dcd02fe6cc6ca78e1bdaec1652b1b0","amp;dn":"The+Mango+Season+-+Amulya+Malladi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc144b763dcd02fe6cc6ca78e1bdaec1652b1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,193,68,183,99,220,208,47,230,204,108,167,142,27,218,236,22,82,177,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
