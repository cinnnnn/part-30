Sinbad (John Philip Law) -- Prince of Baghdad and legendary sailor -- finds an intriguing map and sets sail for the previously uncharted island of Lemuria with a beautiful slave girl, Margiana (Caroline Munro), and the Grand Vizier of the land of Marabia. Prince Koura (Tom Baker), an evil wizard who is trying to gain control of Marabia through his manipulation of malevolent spirits, follows in an effort to thwart Sinbad's quest. Sinbad reaches Lemuria in spite of an enchantment Koura casts upon the giant figurehead of Sinbad's ship which brings it to life. On Lemuria, Sinbad and his stalwart crew encounter a sex-armed sword-brandishing statue, a one-eyed centaur and a griffin. Finally, Sinbad confronts Koura in a face-to-face duel to the death!\n\n\nDirectors:\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Gordon Hessler\n\nActors:\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ John Phillip Law....Sinbad\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Caroline Munro....Margiana\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Tom Baker...Koura\n\n*****************************************************\n\nPlay tested &amp; guarantee working on Philips dvd player (USB stick)!\n\nEnjoy.\n\napr.01.2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691a7afb7c4b4a70b2c99054e17f985a39e2daa5","amp;dn":"GOLDEN+VOYAGE+OF+SINBAD+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691a7afb7c4b4a70b2c99054e17f985a39e2daa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,26,122,251,124,75,74,112,178,201,144,84,225,127,152,90,57,226,218,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
