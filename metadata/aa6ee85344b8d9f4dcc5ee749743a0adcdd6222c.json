In 1961 and 1962 he recorded two incredibly rare steel guitar albums for Philips Records. On them, he tackled 24 songs that feature his beautiful tone, dazzling technique, and bottomless fund of ideas. This CD compiles both of those original LPs and comes with a 20-page booklet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa6ee85344b8d9f4dcc5ee749743a0adcdd6222c","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Day+-+Golden+Steel+Guitar+Hits+-+Steel+%26amp%3B+Strings+-+Bea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa6ee85344b8d9f4dcc5ee749743a0adcdd6222c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,110,232,83,68,184,217,244,220,197,238,116,151,67,160,173,205,214,34,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
