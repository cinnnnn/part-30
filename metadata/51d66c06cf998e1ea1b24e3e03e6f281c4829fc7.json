Does the end justify the means? For Celia Lytton, there are no easy answers to these questions. Strong-willed, tough, and courageous, she moves through life making difficult and often dangerous decisions both for herself and for others, with the most far reaching consequences for everyone . . . For her husband, Oliver, head of the great family publishing house of Lyttons; for Sylvia Miller, whose life of relentless poverty is transformed by Celia's intrusion; for Oliver's daunting elder sister, who is not all she appears to be; and for author Sebastian Brooke, for whom Celia makes the most dangerous decision of all. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d66c06cf998e1ea1b24e3e03e6f281c4829fc7","amp;dn":"No+Angel+-+Penny+Vincenzi%2CLit%2CEpub%2CPdf%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d66c06cf998e1ea1b24e3e03e6f281c4829fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,214,108,6,207,153,142,30,161,178,78,62,3,230,242,129,196,130,159,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
