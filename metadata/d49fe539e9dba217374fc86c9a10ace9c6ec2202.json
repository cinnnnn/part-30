Two men have three things in common: each commits what seems like a perfect murder, each marries his victim's wife far too soon, each has an overdue appointment with the gallows. A man cuts up the body of his victim into little pieces and gets away with the crime until he slaughters another neighbour six years later. Practically Perfect details the crimes of killers who very nearly got away with perfect murders, including the tale of Marie Beaulne, who laced her husband's food with poison, only to be found out when a priest recalled someone else dying that way in his village. Each tale provides specific details on the planning of each murder, the events leading up to the discovery of the criminal, and the results of the trial, usually resulting in an execution.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d49fe539e9dba217374fc86c9a10ace9c6ec2202","amp;dn":"Practically+Perfect+-+Killers+Who+Got+Away+With+Murder+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d49fe539e9dba217374fc86c9a10ace9c6ec2202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,159,229,57,233,219,162,23,55,79,200,108,154,16,172,233,198,236,34,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
