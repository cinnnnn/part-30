Why would someone advise that what you need to cool down is a nice cup of tea? And must you really let red wine breathe first to improve its taste? It also covers why urinating on a jellyfish sting does not help, why cellphones won't give you cancer, and why recycling aluminum cans is not a waste of time. With clear and witty writing, this book examines the science behind many popular myths, revealing why many &quot;truths&quot; we think we know, we don't really know at all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d82fc09e19f5266013e46c5990375c31560ebf7","amp;dn":"Deceived+Wisdom%3A+Why+What+You+Thought+Was+Right+Is+Wrong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d82fc09e19f5266013e46c5990375c31560ebf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,130,252,9,225,159,82,102,1,62,70,197,153,3,117,195,21,96,235,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
