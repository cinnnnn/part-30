Freeing her, he gains a close friendship with the bird. However, Cody is soon abducted by the murderous poacher, Percival McLeach, who is after that bird which is of a highly endangered species and therefore an extremely profitable quarry. In a panic, a mouse Cody freed from one of McLeach&amp;#039;s traps sends a desperate call for help to the Rescue Aid Society in New York City who assigns their top agents, Miss Bianca and Bernard to the task. With transportation provided by the goofy Albatross, Wilbur, the agents arrive in Austrailia and link up with the RAS&amp;#039; local field operative, Jake The Kangaroo Rat. Together, the trio must race against time to find Cody, stop McLeach and save Marahute.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7683c23cc70506221592bee063d90dce5ddeb0e6","amp;dn":"Bernard.Och.Bianca.I.Australien.SWEDISH.DVDRip.XviD-EXTREM-E.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7683c23cc70506221592bee063d90dce5ddeb0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,131,194,60,199,5,6,34,21,146,190,224,99,217,13,206,93,222,176,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
