Understanding the basics of cryptography is fundamental to keeping your networks, systems, and data secure. In this course, Lisa Bock reviews the historical and present-day uses of encryption, including techniques such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, algorithms, and hashing. She also reviews message digest and passwords and provides a demonstration of a typical SSL transaction. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of what it takes to move and store data securely.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUnderstanding why encryption is necessary\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tComparing passive and active network attacks\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tReviewing the terminology and history of cryptography\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUsing symmetric encryption\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDissecting block and stream ciphers\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDissecting the public-key algorithms\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating key pairs\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUnderstanding passwords, hash, salt, and rainbow tables\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tExploring Secure Sockets Layer\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tInvestigating email and IP security\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09d619623372e7010308e5c74b78467c109dc40","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Essentials+of+Cryptography+and+Network+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09d619623372e7010308e5c74b78467c109dc40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,157,97,150,35,55,46,112,16,48,142,92,116,183,132,103,193,9,220,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
