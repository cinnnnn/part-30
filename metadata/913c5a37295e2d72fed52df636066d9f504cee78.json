Over the course of the next twelve months, their lives--and the world around them--will change irrevocably. Fire and Rain tells the story of four iconic albums of 1970 and the lives, times, and constantly intertwining personal ties of the remarkable artists who made them. Acclaimed journalist David Browne sets these stories against an increasingly chaotic backdrop of events that sent the world spinning throughout that tumultuous year: Kent State, the Apollo 13 debacle, ongoing bombings by radical left-wing groups, the diffusion of the antiwar movement, and much more.\n\nFeaturing candid interviews with more than 100 luminaries, including some of the artists themselves, Browne's vivid narrative tells the incredible story of how--over the course of twelve turbulent months--the '60s effectively ended and the '70s began.\n\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Biography | Music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913c5a37295e2d72fed52df636066d9f504cee78","amp;dn":"Fire+and+Rain+-+David+Browne+%28retail%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913c5a37295e2d72fed52df636066d9f504cee78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,60,90,55,41,94,45,114,254,213,45,246,54,6,109,159,80,76,238,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
