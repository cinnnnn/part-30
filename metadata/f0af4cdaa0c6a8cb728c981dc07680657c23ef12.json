Laura Marling, Lana del Rey, Lykke Li, Torres, Florence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a veritable panoply of empowered female mavericks challenging preconceived ideas of what a singer-songwriter should be, but RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2012 debut Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the pleasant-but-insubstantial Like I Used To Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes appeared happy to conform to age-old clichÃƒÂ©s.\nProduced by Rich Cooper (Banks, Mystery Jets) Work It Out strives to change that perception. Songs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœNebraskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy LifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ highlight RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice, which is unfailingly lovely yet oddly characterless: she originally made her name as a backing vocalist, and her fragile, quivering delivery can still sound more like a supplemental texture than a defining feature. Happily, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a greater sense of dynamism at play in the songs themselves. Opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ begins as an acoustic ramble through some very familiar territory before a gathering groundswell propels it into towards FlorenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stratosphere, whilst the tricksy afro-pop licks of Ã¢â‚¬ËœKÃƒÂ¶lnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hints at the influence of RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sometime collaborators Bombay Bicycle Club on her songwriting.\n\nThere are subtle, livening electronic flourishes throughout, but the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most memorable moments are the ones, like Ã¢â‚¬ËœOur EyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or the sleek Ã¢â‚¬ËœCover UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, where Rose fully commits. What Ã¢â‚¬ËœWork It OutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ never quite manages to do, however, is leave any sort of lasting impression: the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s near 45-minute runtime passes with the agreeable impermanence of a mid-afternoon reverie, a pleasing diversion that melts imperceptibly away as soon as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to escape the conclusion that Rose remains a voice in search of, well, a voice.\nRating\n\nTracklist:\n01 - For You.flac\n02 - Our Eyes.flac\n03 - Like an Arrow.flac\n04 - Nebraska.flac\n05 - KoÃŒË†ln.flac\n06 - Shelter.flac\n07 - My Life.flac\n08 - Fly High (Interlude).flac\n09 - Till the End.flac\n10 - Cover Up.flac\n11 - She'll Move.flac\n12 - Work It Out.flac\n13 - Into the Wild.flac\n14 - Sheffield.flac\n15 - Lone Ranger.flac\n16 - I Tried.flac\n17 - Like That.flac\n18 - Shiver (Live from RAK Studios).flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Indie-Folk\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~693-953 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0af4cdaa0c6a8cb728c981dc07680657c23ef12","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Lucy+Rose+-+Work+It+Out+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0af4cdaa0c6a8cb728c981dc07680657c23ef12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,175,76,218,160,198,168,203,114,140,152,29,192,118,128,101,124,35,239,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
