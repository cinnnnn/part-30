As Always please comment so I know if these are uploading right. Like this will be my first time trying to include a .srt file well see if it makes it , wish me luck!\n\nStoryline:  \nThis all takes place in the forgotten back-allies of San Francisco's Chinatown in the mid- '80s:\nWhen trucker Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) agreed to take his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) to pick up his fiancÃƒÂ©e at the airport, he never expected to get involved in a supernatural battle between good and evil. Wang's fiancÃƒÂ©e has emerald green eyes, which make her a perfect target for an immortal sorcerer named Lo Pan (James Hong) and his three invincible cronies. Lo Pan must marry a girl with green eyes so he can regain his physical form. Now, Jack must save Wang's fiancÃƒÂ©e from Lo Pan and his henchmen, and win back his stolen truck. But how can he defeat an enemy who has no body?\n\nMain Cast: \nKurt Russell ==== Jack Burton\nKim Cattrall ==== Gracie Law\nDennis Dun ==== Wang Chi\nJames Hong ==== David Lo Pan\n\nCompatibility: \nWorks on my Sammie 46&quot; 7100 Series 3D 1080p LED HDTV. I can hook my WD Passport {or even a memory stick}  hard drive up to the USB connection {on the input panel} and it works. I personally run it through my Sammie Blu Ray player {through the front USB port} so I can use my Onyko TX-SR875 Audio/Video Processor for better sound and picture. Plug and Play no conversion necessary!\n\nPlays With: WMP {11}, PowerDVD, Nero Kwik Media, QuickTime, and played it on my Droid Maxx as is. Haven't tried any others but doesn't seem to have any problems playing on whatever I open it with it's .MP4 should play on most anything. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4acb65c7233720a61534dfa7436dda0243e1b31d","amp;dn":"Big+Trouble+In+Little+China+720p+DD+5.1+%5B1986%5D+Adventure+doesn%27t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4acb65c7233720a61534dfa7436dda0243e1b31d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,203,101,199,35,55,32,166,21,52,223,167,67,109,218,2,67,225,179,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
