Anyway, this record is amazing, it works brilliantly as a whole and I never get tired of it. Not my favourite Calexico but probably one of my year 2000's top albums\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db3b6d0fe1c9b52197c394ece86096cfa7e97e1d","amp;dn":"Calexico...Hot+Rail%282000%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db3b6d0fe1c9b52197c394ece86096cfa7e97e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,59,109,15,225,201,181,33,151,195,148,236,232,96,150,207,167,233,126,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
