Awakening with vials implanted in the base of their skulls (which of course are instantly fatal if removed), a grinning professional type informs them via TV screens that they have a certain length of time to fill these vials with a specific amount of brain fluid. Fluid that is most easily produced during bouts of extreme pain. You can see where this is going already, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you? Along with another band of unlucky subjects, they all get together to bring the pain to each other and share the burden of reaching their target. \n\nGenre: Horror \nIMDB Rating: 5.3/10 \nDirected by: Taylor Sheridan \nStarring: Eric Jay Beck, April Matson and Akeem Smith \n\nRelease Name: Vile.2011.DVDRip.XviD-PRiMOR \nSize: 700 MB \nVideo: XviD, 640Ãƒâ€”352, 981 Kbps \nAudio: English, MP3, 128 kbps \nRuntime: 1H27M07S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3af88f1981d38bf05889b0641054d0005a177f6","amp;dn":"Vile+2011+DVDRip+XviD-PRiMOR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3af88f1981d38bf05889b0641054d0005a177f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,175,136,241,152,29,56,191,5,136,155,6,65,5,77,0,5,161,119,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
