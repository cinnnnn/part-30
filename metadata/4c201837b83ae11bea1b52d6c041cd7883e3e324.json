Connecting all the stories in this novel is Bobby Beausoleil, a beautiful California boy who appeared in an Anger film and eventually joined the Manson &quot;family.&quot;\n\nWith great artistry, Lazar weaves scenes from these real lives together into a true but heightened reality, making superstars human, giving demons reality, and restoring mythic events to the scale of daily life.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction, Music | Rock N Roll","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c201837b83ae11bea1b52d6c041cd7883e3e324","amp;dn":"Sway+by+Zachary+Lazar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c201837b83ae11bea1b52d6c041cd7883e3e324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,32,24,55,184,58,225,27,234,27,82,214,192,65,205,120,131,227,227,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
