Not the most dramatic central section to an episode, but refreshingly car-based compared to last season's antics which saw houses demolished by machines of war.\n\nWhile this segment was bankable Top Gear fodder, more risky was Clarkson's decision to make light of his famous comments on the One Show. 'You're going to be shot in front of your family' he told James May, 'because apparently you can say that on television'. The broadcaster of course references Ofcom's recent ruling that the remarks he made about striking public sector workers were not inappropriate, a pretty sensible decision that Clarkson is clearly delighted by.\n\nElsewhere Alex James was the Star In A Reasonably Priced Car, unfortunately being given yet another platform on which to talk about cheese, and setting a decent but middling time of 45.2 that equaled Cameron Diaz on the leaderboard.\n\nClarkson also test drove some remarkable relics in the form of a Bentley powered by an aircraft engine and fire-spitting BMW in not the most memorable episode of Top Gear, but thoroughly watchable all the same.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/tv/reviews/892128-top-gear-saw-clarkson-make-another-shot-in-front-of-their-family-joke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metro.co.uk/tv/reviews/892128-top-gear-saw-clarkson-make-another-shot-in-front-of-their-family-joke&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fa26c4b9876953a421a8f568174c97ab0983c13","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+S18E06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fa26c4b9876953a421a8f568174c97ab0983c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,162,108,75,152,118,149,58,66,26,143,86,129,116,201,122,176,152,60,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
