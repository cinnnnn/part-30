This was a nice MOR album at the time -- it's aged decently, as it still sounds good today. \n\nA1 Cat Dancer   4:50 \nA2 Get My Way   4:06 \nA3 Think of Me   4:28 \nA4 Living End   3:50 \nA5 Saddest Victory   4:10 \nB1 Not Like the Others   4:22 \nB2 I Pretend   3:42 \nB3 Mind Over Matter   4:04 \nB4 Leave I`t All Behind   4:44 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02359e4c3f70ec59d483cb28fd60bbcf26773d5","amp;dn":"Sandy+Stewart+-+Cat+Dancer+%5B1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02359e4c3f70ec59d483cb28fd60bbcf26773d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,35,89,228,195,247,14,197,157,72,60,178,143,214,11,188,242,103,115,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
