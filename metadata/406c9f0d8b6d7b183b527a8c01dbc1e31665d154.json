Dina SilverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tender, absorbing novel, One Pink Line, is the warmhearted, wry story of love, loss and family, as seen through the prism of one singular, spirited young couple who find themselves in a predicament that changes the course of their lives, and those closest to them. With heart, humor and compassion, this debut work of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction is certain to stir anyone who relishes a good laugh, can stand a good cry, and, above all believes in the redemptive power of love.\n\nThis unique, contemporary story gives readers a dual perspective. Sydney Shephard, a sweet-tempered, strong-natured college senior is young, in love with an exceptional man, and unexpectedly pregnant. Faced with a child she never planned for, she is forced to relay this news to her neurotic mother, relinquish her youth, and risk losing the love of her life. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grace, a daughter, who believed she was a product of this great love, grows to realize her existence is not what she assumed, and is left with profound and puzzling questions about who she really is.\n\nSpanning generations and every imaginable emotion, One Pink Line reveals how two points of view can be dramatically at odds, and perhaps ultimately reconciled. Simultaneously deeply felt and lighthearted, One Pink Line deftly mines how the choices we make are able to alter so many lives, and how doing the right thing and living honestly can bring unexpected, hard-won happiness. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a must-read for anyone who relishes a great love story, absorbing characters, and plenty of laughs along the way.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406c9f0d8b6d7b183b527a8c01dbc1e31665d154","amp;dn":"One+Pink+Line+by+Dina+Silver+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406c9f0d8b6d7b183b527a8c01dbc1e31665d154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,108,159,13,139,109,123,24,59,82,122,140,1,219,193,227,22,101,209,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
