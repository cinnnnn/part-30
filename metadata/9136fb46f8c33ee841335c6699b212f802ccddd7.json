A Must-See!\n\nDescription from the DVD:\n\n&quot;The air above Jerusalem is filled with prayers and dreams Like air above cities with heavy industry Hard to breathe. From time to time a new shipment of history arrives&quot; Yehuda Amiehai\n\nThe latest shipment of history is the Israeli occupation. In 1948, the western part of the city fell under Israeli control; in 1967, the eastern part fell under Israeli occupation. Since then, Israel has pursued a policy of Judaizing the city, aiming to achieve &quot;Jewish demographic superiority.&quot; Part of this policy is to drive Palestinian Muslims and Christians out of the city; denying their presence, history, and ties to the land.\n\nThe documentary takes you on a journey exposing Israel's policy to gain supremacy and hegemony over the city and its inhabitants. It also touches on the future of the city: Jerusalem is the key to peace; without Jerusalem, there is no peace for anyone.\n\nThe film includes interviews with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, human rights activists and political analysts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9136fb46f8c33ee841335c6699b212f802ccddd7","amp;dn":"Jerusalem+-+DVD+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9136fb46f8c33ee841335c6699b212f802ccddd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,54,251,70,248,195,62,232,65,51,92,102,153,178,18,248,2,204,221,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
