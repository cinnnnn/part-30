He tells us about his Monday night and the beverages he consumed (and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), takes a call which leads to sharing stories pertaining to his relationship with Opie as well as his views on ISIS, and then shows us a personal photo from the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s with Bob Hope. Ant revisits Ã¢â‚¬Å“sploshing videosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“young Nucky ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show, gives us a new gem from Rev. Al, shows us a Shop at Home Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beanie BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ clip, a tazing video, and an absent KtC calls in to give his take on the video. We hear a bullying story out of Italy, read some tweets from a possibly drunk Louis CK, and he ends the show with a few videos involving unnecessary violence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42d85b56e12b6830e41694e6a592934b6da66a2","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42d85b56e12b6830e41694e6a592934b6da66a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,45,133,181,110,18,182,131,14,65,105,78,106,89,41,52,182,218,102,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
