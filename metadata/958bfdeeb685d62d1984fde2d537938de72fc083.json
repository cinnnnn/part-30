The warfare of the French and Indian War was diverse, ranging from savage fighting in the forests and plains of the North American frontier to city sieges and open battles, as the British Army struggled with the terrain and the tactics of the opposing French and Native Americans. This book examines the progression of the war, as the British Army learned from their allies, initiated reforms, and eventually triumphed over the French and Canadians. The implications of this conflict reached across the world, contributing to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe and discontent on the Indian subcontinent. This highly illustrated book charts the campaigns of the war, detailing the different troops raised and involved, the evolving tactics, the fortresses, and, battles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958bfdeeb685d62d1984fde2d537938de72fc083","amp;dn":"Empires+Collide+-+The+French+and+Indian+War+1754-63+-+Ruth+Shepp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958bfdeeb685d62d1984fde2d537938de72fc083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,139,253,238,182,133,214,45,25,132,253,226,213,55,147,141,231,47,192,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
