Battered by years of bearing ill tidings, he clings to the hope of revealing, just once, a truth that will do some good in the world. It is a redemption that has long eluded him.\n\nThen Britten and his unconventional partner, Brulightly, take on the mysterious death of Berni Kudos. The official verdict is suicide, but Berni's fiancÃƒÂ©e is convinced that the reality is something more sinister. Blackmail, revenge, murder: each new revelation stirs up the muddy waters of painful family secrets, and each fresh twist takes the partners further from Britten's longed-for salvation. Doing good in the world, he discovers, may have more to do with silence than truth.\n\nA haunting story of love and grief, sharply written and luminously drawn, Britten and BrÃƒÂ¼lightly is sure to establish Hannah Berry in the front rank of graphic novelists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdc64a7aefc934cc9047f85bf3029a240f8db0c","amp;dn":"Hannah+Berry+-+Britten+And+Brulightly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdc64a7aefc934cc9047f85bf3029a240f8db0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,220,100,167,174,252,147,76,201,4,127,133,191,48,41,162,64,248,219,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
