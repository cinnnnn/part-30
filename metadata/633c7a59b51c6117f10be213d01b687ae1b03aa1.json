Levine Books, Mazer brings us TEN WAYS TO MAKE MY SISTER DISAPPEAR, a humorous look at a blistering sister rivalry.\n\nEverything ten year-old Sprig wants, her older sister Dakota already has. Everything Sprig does, Dakota does better. And anytime Sprig complains, Dakota just grins and calls her a baby. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough to make a kid wish her sister would disappear.\n\nBut in a year when SprigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father is away, her favorite neighbor is ill, and the class bully is acting almost like, well, a boyfriend, Sprig discovers that allies come in unexpected shapes. Sometimes theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re even related to you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633c7a59b51c6117f10be213d01b687ae1b03aa1","amp;dn":"Ten+Ways+to++Sister+Disappear+by+Norma+Fox+Mazer+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633c7a59b51c6117f10be213d01b687ae1b03aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,60,122,89,181,28,97,23,241,11,226,19,208,27,104,122,225,176,58,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
