ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struck a chord with media, from CBS This Morning to USA Today, and Temple Grandin has praised it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“amazing. It shows the power of friendship.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nNow its author, Jennifer Holland, who writes about animal relationships with insight, compassion, and a fine narrative touch, explores animal attachments that, in human terms, can only be called love.\nPacked with beautiful, breathtaking full-color photographs, Unlikely Loves is a celebration of love between species. Here are stories of parental love, like the Dalmatian who mothers a newborn lambÃ¢â‚¬â€a lamb that just happens to be white with black spots! Stories of playful love, including the fox and the hound who become inseparable. And stories of orphaned animals who have found family-like ties in unexpected combinations, like the elephant whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bonded with sea lions, goats, and other animals in her walks around the Oregon Zoo.\nMs. Holland has interviewed scientists, zoologists, and animal caretakers from around the world, tracking down firsthand sources and eyewitnesses. The stories are written with journalistic integrity and detailÃ¢â‚¬â€and always filled with the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep affection for her subjects.\n\nAbout the Author\nJennifer S.
