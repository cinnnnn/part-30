In the last decade it has become evident that the successful development of chemical and biochemical sensors resistant to the harsh conditions in the various routine applications calls for a cooperation between chemists and engineers. Thus, this book aims at instructing researcher and practitioners in both disciplines in a strictly systematic, interdisciplinary and practice-oriented way about the basic technology of chemical and biochemical sensors. This concise volume bridges the gap between the different &quot;ways of thinking&quot; in chemistry, physics and engineering. It provides a firm grounding for engineers, industrial and academic researcher in the field, for practitioners and novices as well as for advanced students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a201a99dbbce88e5d20520740f582e394fea0392","amp;dn":"Chemical+Sensors+-+An+Introduction+for+Scientists+and+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a201a99dbbce88e5d20520740f582e394fea0392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,1,169,157,187,206,136,229,210,5,32,116,15,88,46,57,79,234,3,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
