Copy the 2 files in this crack folder (&quot;DDSPB3 v1.7 Patch - SoN.exe&quot; and &quot;Mono.Cecil.dll&quot;) to the installed DDSPB3 folder. Execute &quot;DDSPB3 v1.3 Patch - SoN.exe&quot; and that's it. I know this is our first release which includes a DLL but it's our first patch for a .NET program and the DLL is needed to run the patch. Both files can be deleted once the patch is applied if you so choose. Thanks for understanding.\n\nNotes: Thanks for testing, Raven. If anyone can find his duck it would be greatly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10ebf4d0697b18c5b52c3330b0b68d9477acb9a","amp;dn":"DraftDaySports+Pro+Basketball+3+v1.7+Patch++%5BSoN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10ebf4d0697b18c5b52c3330b0b68d9477acb9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,14,191,77,6,151,177,140,91,82,195,51,11,11,104,217,71,122,203,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
