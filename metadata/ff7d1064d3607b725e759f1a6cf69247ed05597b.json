THIS GAME IS A GAME RIP AND IS FOR J-TAG/RGH ONLY. THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ISO!!!\n\nAlaskan Storm lets you captain your own boat in a search for the Red Gold of the Bering Sea. Select one of five real crab boats, including the Northwestern, Cornelia Marie and more, or create and customize your own boat. Recruit and lead your own crew from a roster of twenty real life crab fishermen. Selecting the wrong boat or recruiting the wrong crew member can mean the difference between landing a Bering Sea jackpot or disaster. Lead your crew in the strategic search for King and Opilio Crab while battling to secure your catch and livelihood before other captains and crews get to the crab first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7d1064d3607b725e759f1a6cf69247ed05597b","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Catch+Alaskan+Storm+%28j-TAG%2FRGH+ONLY%29+XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7d1064d3607b725e759f1a6cf69247ed05597b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,125,16,100,211,96,123,114,94,117,159,26,108,246,146,71,237,5,89,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
