No Tellin Lies and 3.V were originally purchased from iTunes and would have been unplayable by everyone except me. I have converted to .mp3.\n2. IV came from another source here on the bay and had many problems such as skips, sudden endings and track six was completely corrupt. I was able to repair most of it but you will still notice problems here and there. Can't help it. If you find a better copy leave a comment and torrent link for me.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZebra is a hard rock band founded in 1975 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It features Randy Jackson (guitar and vocals), Felix Hanemann (bass, keyboards and vocals) and Guy Gelso (drums and vocals). Their mainstream debut on Atlantic Records was in 1983, highlighted by the singles Tell Me What You Want and Whos Behind The Door. Like Twisted Sister, Zebra cut their teeth on the East Coast club circuit, frequently playing at clubs on Long Island, NY.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.thedoor.com/\n\noriginal torrent and many others located at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/cheborneck/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fffe66f4df433f86f2a430bc0c3b59fb93b82a82","amp;dn":"Zebra+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fffe66f4df433f86f2a430bc0c3b59fb93b82a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,254,102,244,223,67,63,134,242,164,48,188,12,59,89,251,147,184,42,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
