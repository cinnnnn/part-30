They were originally active from 1977 to 1984 and have been active again from 1988 to present. The band's sound is a mix of Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) and pop rock, and they have released a total of 13 albums to date.\n\nPrism's success has been primarily in Canada where they won the Canadian music industry Juno Award for Group of the Year in 1981, although they also reached the US top 40 charts with 1981's &quot;Don't Let Him Know&quot;. Prism is also noteworthy for launching the careers of several former group members, including international record producer Bruce Fairbairn, songwriter Jim Vallance, Powder Blues Band frontman Tom Lavin, and Headpins and Chilliwack musician Ab Bryant. A pre-fame Bryan Adams also contributed as a songwriter to several early Prism releases.\n\nOn Sunday, March 6, 2011, Prism's Spaceship Superstar was chosen as the wakeup song for the Space Shuttle Discovery crew members. This was a significant point in history as it was the last day that the crews of the Space Shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station were together before Discovery returned to earth in the last mission of the shuttle Discovery.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee Forever Eyes is the second release by Canadian rock band Prism. It was released in 1978 (see 1978 in music) by Canadian record label GRT. It was produced by Bruce Fairbairn.\n\n&quot;N-N-N-No!&quot; and &quot;You're Like The Wind&quot; are both credited to Rodney Higgs (Jim Vallance) as songwriter. Allan Harlow contributed two songs, &quot;Flyin'&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;. Hall and Mitchell are credited with &quot;See Forever Eyes&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e75c763576c41dcb89ed55a92aa61a86790e0ba","amp;dn":"Prism+-+See+Forever+Eyes+%5B1978%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e75c763576c41dcb89ed55a92aa61a86790e0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,117,199,99,87,108,65,220,184,158,213,90,146,170,97,168,103,144,224,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
