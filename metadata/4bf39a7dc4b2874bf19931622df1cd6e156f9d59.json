It is the third installment in the Modern Warfare series, a direct sequel to 2009\\'s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and the eighth Call of Duty installment.\n\nThe game was released on November 8, 2011 in Europe and North America on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii, with a separate version for Nintendo DS developed by n-Space. In Australia, the Wii version was released on November 23, 2011. In Japan, Square Enix handled the installment with a separate subtitled and dubbed version, as they did for Call of Duty: Black Ops. They first released a Japanese-subtitled version on November 17, 2011. Then, on December 22, 2011, they released a Japanese-voice dubbed version. Within 24 hours of going on sale, the game sold 6.5 million copies in the US and UK alone and grossed $400 million, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.\n\nGameplay\n\nLike its predecessors, Modern Warfare 3 is a first-person shooter video game. Activision confirmed at Gamescom 2011, that Modern Warfare 3 on the PC has dedicated servers support.\n\nCampaign\n\nThe player assumes the role of various characters during the single-player campaign, changing perspectives throughout the progression of the story, which, like its preceedors, is divided into three sets of missions called \\&quot;Acts\\&quot;. Each mission in an act features a series of objectives that are displayed on the heads up display, which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives. Damage to the player is shown by the percentage of blood splatter shown on the screen. The player\\'s health regenerates over time. Mission objectives vary in their requirements, ranging from having the player arrive at a particular checkpoint, to eliminating enemies in a specified location, to standing their ground against enemy squadrons, manning mini-guns and other weapons, and planting explosive charges on an enemy installation. Some of these objectives can be failed, and may or may not hinder progression of the story. The player is also accompanied by fellow soldiers who cannot be issued orders.\n\n\n\nenjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*GLOBE FILES 2011*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf39a7dc4b2874bf19931622df1cd6e156f9d59","amp;dn":"CALL+OF+DUTY+MODERN+WARFARE+3+PORTABLE+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf39a7dc4b2874bf19931622df1cd6e156f9d59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,243,154,125,196,178,135,75,241,153,49,98,45,241,205,110,21,111,157,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
