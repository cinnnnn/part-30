Then I was able to \nreread some passages in old english to appreciate old Bill's phrasing\n... not bad!\n\nHave fun... and please make sharing one of your life's goals. \n\nThought for the day:  Copyright should be limited to 5 years from \nthe earlier of creation or first publication.  This encourages creative\nbuilding on what came before.  It also recognizes that the value of any\nwell known cultural item (such as a book, movie, or song) comes mostly \nfrom the shared understanding the public has about the work, not from \nthe creator of the work.  ie - Social Popularity is a reward from the \npublic, thus it should be owned by the public.  It is separate from the \nwork itself. \n\n-- freeflow123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2827f6197b866f2ac7b374dd8338335fcbec042","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Plays+in+Old+English%2C+and+New+English%2C+side+by+sid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2827f6197b866f2ac7b374dd8338335fcbec042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,130,127,97,151,184,102,242,172,123,55,77,216,51,131,53,252,190,192,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
