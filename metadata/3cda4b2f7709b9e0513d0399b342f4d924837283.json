Uniquely for a Deep Purple studio album, it features a reworking of a previously recorded song -&quot;Bloodsucker&quot; from Deep Purple in Rock (here re-titled &quot;Bludsucker&quot;). &quot;Don't Make Me Happy&quot; was mistakenly mastered in mono, and not amended on the final release.\n\nThe album was recorded at Greg Rike Studios, Orlando, Florida, during 1997/98. Engineered by Darren Schneider. It was Deep Purple's last studio album with founding member Jon Lord.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cda4b2f7709b9e0513d0399b342f4d924837283","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+Abandon+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cda4b2f7709b9e0513d0399b342f4d924837283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,218,75,47,119,9,185,224,81,61,3,153,179,66,244,217,36,131,114,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
