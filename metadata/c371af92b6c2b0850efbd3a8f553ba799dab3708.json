Dasapont already has a son, the social worker and professor Ashok (Pendharkar), who is horrified at his father's decision and begs Sushila to reconsider, but she marries the old man anyway. Sushila later admits to Ashok (now her stepson) that it was a mistake, and when she has to take refuge in his room to escape from her husband she is accused of adultery with Ashok, who then becomes a social outcast to the distress of his girlfriend Pushpa (Meenakshi). Sushila leaves having written letters explaining all to Ashok and Pushpa. Years later she is heard singing on a radio station. \n\nMarathi filmmaker Master Vinayak directs this popular melodrama about self-sacrificing siblings. In order to raise money for her younger brother's education, young beautiful Sushila (Indira Wadkar) agrees to marry a conservative widower named Dasopant (Salvi). Dasopant's son, a professor who is about the same age as Sushila, named Ashok (Baburao Pendharkar), tells her that she will regret marrying this old man, but Sushila goes ahead with the wedding. Years later, she comes to realize that Ashok was right. When she hides out from her raging husband in Ashok's room, she is accused of adultery. Ashok is, in turn, branded an outcast much to the chagrin of his girlfriend Pushpa (Meenakshi). Sushila writes a long letter to Ashok and to Pushpa explaining everything. Later, Sushila becomes a radio singer\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1028 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 113kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:Marathi\nRunTime Per Part: 2:10:01\nSubtitles:NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 2:10:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c371af92b6c2b0850efbd3a8f553ba799dab3708","amp;dn":"Devata+%281939%29+Marathi_Xvid+2cd_No+Subs_Indian+Cinema_The+Early+Y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c371af92b6c2b0850efbd3a8f553ba799dab3708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,113,175,146,182,194,176,133,14,251,211,168,245,83,186,121,157,171,55,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
