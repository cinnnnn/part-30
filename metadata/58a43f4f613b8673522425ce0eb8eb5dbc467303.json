Fitzgerald has developed the disturbing ability to look into his men's faces and know who will be killed in the next battle. He says it's like a light is shined on their face. His superior, Capt. Phil Riker, consults the medical officer but he finds nothing conclusive. Fitzgerald passes out when visiting one of his wounded men in the hospital after he sees the light on his face. When he sees the light on Riker's face, he begs him not to go out. After they return from the operation, he sees that there will be one other casualty that day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a43f4f613b8673522425ce0eb8eb5dbc467303","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+The+Purple+Testament","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a43f4f613b8673522425ce0eb8eb5dbc467303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,164,63,79,97,59,134,115,82,36,37,206,14,184,235,93,188,70,115,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
