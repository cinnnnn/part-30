When the Center for Disease Control's Dr. Dave Broda institutes a lockdown on the hospital and suspends House's team's ability to diagnose, Masters grows suspicious of Broda's motives and becomes convinced that the patient is suffering from a different disease. The girl's father soon experiences similar symptoms, and House is forced to make a precarious decision that puts his own life in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Wilson and Sam comfort a 6-year-old chemotherapy patient who prompts them to examine their relationship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9bfeb1fa05dd70b88bf7be5937ade81faa7fdf","amp;dn":"House+S07E07++A+Pox+on+Our+House++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9bfeb1fa05dd70b88bf7be5937ade81faa7fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,155,254,177,250,5,221,112,184,139,247,190,89,55,173,232,31,170,127,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
