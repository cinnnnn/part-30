The objective of this handbook is twofold: to provide the Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic (A&amp;P) with the method of determining the empty weight and empty-weight center of gravity (EWCG) of an aircraft, and to furnish the flightcrew with information on loading and operating the aircraft to ensure its weight is within the allowable limit and the center of gravity (CG) is within the allowable range. Any time there is a conflict between the information in this handbook and specific information issued by an aircraft manufacturer, the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data takes precedence over information in this handbook. Occasionally, the word must or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de23b0be18d2b412d56774de144dc36e18d3c00d","amp;dn":"Aircraft+Weight+and+Balance+Handbook%3A+FAA-H-8083-1a+.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de23b0be18d2b412d56774de144dc36e18d3c00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,35,176,190,24,210,180,18,213,103,116,222,20,77,195,110,24,211,192,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
