(2013)\nSACD rip at 24 bits, 88.2 KHz\n\nDean Martin finally got access to conductor/arranger Nelson Riddle for an album project, and the result was an easy swinging collection with appealing horn charts and a series of comfortable readings of recent and vintage standards. Especially notable were the two songs borrowed from My Fair Lady, &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; and &quot;I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,&quot; which Martin and Riddle re-imagined as straight-forward love songs; &quot;You're Nobody 'til Somebody Loves You&quot; (which Martin would try again in a more contemporary arrangement four years later for one of his biggest hits); and a solo version of &quot;Just in Time,&quot; which the singer had recently done with Judy Holliday in the film version of the musical Bells Are Ringing. This Time I'm Swingin'! was a good, confident set by an artist who had figured out how to make competent albums without expending a lot of effort, which was a key to his charm.
