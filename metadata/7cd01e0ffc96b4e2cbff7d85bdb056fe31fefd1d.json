She's the hippest girl who ever lived. She's incredibly ticklish!\n\nWell... one out of three ain't bad...\n\nYes, it's true! Colin, the writer-creator of Tammi the Tickle Witch and Lexi, has joined forces with artist Rocio Zucchi to bring the world a brand-new ticklish heroine. Maggs is a slacker princess who'd love nothing more than to be a rock star - or, failing that, to pay the rent and get her bitchy room-mates off her back. Unfortunately, she keeps falling into situations of extreme barefoot (and bare-bellied, and bare-underarmed) peril. Maybe she'll get make the A-List one day... if she can just stop laughing!\n\nIn her first adventure, Maggs gets word that her favorite band is giving a free show at a downtown club. She's determined to make the scene, but her roommate Deirdre has confiscated her favorite pair of boots until she helps her study. Maggs manages to tickle brainiac Deirdre into submission... but she has two more roommates to contend with... and Maggs is pretty ticklish herself!,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd01e0ffc96b4e2cbff7d85bdb056fe31fefd1d","amp;dn":"Maggs+-+Tickling+comic%3A+Issues+1%2C+2%2C+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd01e0ffc96b4e2cbff7d85bdb056fe31fefd1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,208,30,15,252,150,180,226,203,255,125,133,189,176,86,254,49,254,253,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
