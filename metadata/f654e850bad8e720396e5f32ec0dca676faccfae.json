Each issue is intended to be a stand-alone short story, taking place in a different town across North America.  Each issue features Megan McKeenan, a young woman who sets out from Portland, Oregon with nothing but a rucksack and a bad case of wanderlust.   These emotional vignettes each represent a year in the life of this young vagabond as she searches for a place to call home, both physically and spiritually.  Megan is the main character in some issues, while in others she is a spectator or background figure.\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f654e850bad8e720396e5f32ec0dca676faccfae","amp;dn":"Local+%28Oni+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f654e850bad8e720396e5f32ec0dca676faccfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,84,232,80,186,216,231,32,57,110,95,50,236,13,202,103,111,172,207,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
