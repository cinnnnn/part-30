It was recorded in binaural stereo, which means that it is best heard through headphones rather than speakers.\n\nThe_Revenge_long.mp3 contains an introduction by the author and Ronald Mason, head of drama for BBC Radio at the time at the start of the play and full credits at the end of the play.\n\nThe_Revenge_play.mp3 contains only the play, with no introduction or credits.\n\nThere are unlikely to be many people interested in this play, but those who are will be keen indeed, so please keep seeding for as long as you are able!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d82cfce80af7e4197a7ddffda8f16302910f840","amp;dn":"The+Revenge+-+Andrew+Sachs+-+1978+radio+play+without+words","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d82cfce80af7e4197a7ddffda8f16302910f840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,130,207,206,128,175,126,65,151,167,221,255,218,143,22,48,41,16,248,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
