They love the good life, and though they can be shrewd (or selectively deaf, or consciously naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve), the Shih Tzu is so endearing that even ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbig dogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lovers find themselves swooning over this adorable breed. But is the Chinese Charmer the right match for you? Shih Tzu for Dummies answers all of your questions, like:\n\n    * What is a Shih Tzu really like?\n    * Can I get a Shih Tzu if I have children or other pets?\n    * How difficult is grooming? Can I do it myself or should I get a professional?\n    * How do I find a good breeder? What about a good vet?\n    * What should my Shih Tzu eat?\n    * Do small dogs really need that much training?\n    * How can I teach my Shih Tzu some basic commands? \n\nThe Shih Tzu is built for one job and one job alone: to be your close personal friend for life.
