I searched around for about 2 hours to find these and it took about 4 hours to download because of the small amount of seeders. I will probably upload season 2 soonish as well.\nI will seed for a week or so, but not 24/7 because I will turn my torrent client off if I am using Skype or something.\nIf you download this please seed back at least what you downloaded, it helps out a lot!\nAll these episodes are of high enough A/V to watch and enjoy, but please comment if there is something wrong.\nI recommend you use VLC Player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or GOM player (http://www.gomlab.com/eng/GMP_download.html) to watch. GOM player is my personal favorite because of the nicer interface, and keyboard controls (enter puts full screen on, space pauses/plays, arrows to skip, etc) are much better IMO.\nThanks, and enjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cbf326d3b8f0b10157151fd93d358420fb1e7eb","amp;dn":"Lee+Nelson%5C%27s+Well+Good+Show%21+Season+1+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cbf326d3b8f0b10157151fd93d358420fb1e7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,191,50,109,59,143,11,16,21,113,81,253,147,211,88,66,15,177,231,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
