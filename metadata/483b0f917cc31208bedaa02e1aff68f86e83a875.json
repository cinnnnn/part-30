We learn about a new apology given by ESPN, talk Uzi's, Chelsea Handler leaving late night TV, and we catch a glimpse of Chip Chipperson. Chip then calls into the hotline, Ant takes a few more calls, and we end the show with a video that Nick DiPaolo suggested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483b0f917cc31208bedaa02e1aff68f86e83a875","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-27+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483b0f917cc31208bedaa02e1aff68f86e83a875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,59,15,145,124,195,18,8,190,218,160,46,26,255,104,248,110,131,168,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
