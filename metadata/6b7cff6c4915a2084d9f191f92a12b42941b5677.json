The book is complex and does not easily transfer to a 2 hour dramatisation and for me too much was lost in the cause of prioritising the romance between Winston and Julia. I have not read the book for some years, but there was one element I really do not remember which also slightly affects - and for me weakens - the ending.\n\nEnjoy anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7cff6c4915a2084d9f191f92a12b42941b5677","amp;dn":"Nineteen+Eighty+Four+-+Radio+Dramatisation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7cff6c4915a2084d9f191f92a12b42941b5677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,124,255,108,73,21,162,8,77,159,25,31,146,161,43,66,148,27,86,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
