While Shank had advanced as an improviser (developing a wider range of expression and playing with more intensity than previously), Rogers' cool-toned style was largely unchanged. With pianist George Cables, bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Sherman Ferguson completing the quintet, Shank and Shorty perform three of Rogers' originals plus inventive reworkings of four swing and bop standards arranged by the flugelhornist. A fine outing.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - It's Sand, Man\n02 - Makin' Whoopee\n03 - Kansas City Tango\n04 - Ah-Leu-Cha\n05 - Echoes Of Harlem\n06 - Mia\n07 - Aurex\n\nEnjoy and share!
