So, I purchased it from gog.com and decided to share it here :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abb53580aa3b00cac674326cdadb0164415f6db","amp;dn":"setup_shattered_steel.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abb53580aa3b00cac674326cdadb0164415f6db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,187,83,88,10,163,176,12,172,103,67,38,205,173,176,22,68,21,246,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
