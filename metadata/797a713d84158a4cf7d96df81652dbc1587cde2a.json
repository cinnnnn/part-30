The band was composed of singer/bassist John Wetton (formerly of King Crimson, \nRoxy Music, Bryan Ferry's band and Uriah Heep), keyboardist/electric violinist \nEddie Jobson (formerly of Curved Air, Roxy Music and Frank Zappa's band), \nguitarist Allan Holdsworth (formerly of Tempest, Soft Machine, The New Tony Williams \nLifetime and Gong) and drummer Bill Bruford (formerly a full member of Yes and King \nCrimson, and also a tour drummer for Genesis), later replaced by drummer Terry \nBozzio (formerly of Frank Zappa's band). UK have recently reformed with John \nWetton, Eddie Jobson and Terry Bozzio for a world tour in 2012.\n\nFormation and first album\nSinger/bassist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford had worked together in King \nCrimson from 1972-4, when guitarist Robert Fripp disbanded the group. In July 1976, \nBruford assisted Wetton on demos for a proposed solo album by the latter (a couple \nof these demos were later released on Monkey Business). In September 1976, they \nworked on forming a band with keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had previously worked \nwith Bruford in Yes. The project was stopped by Wakeman's label. According to Bruford, \n&quot;A&amp;M Records were unwilling to let their 'star,' Wakeman, walk off with a used, \nslightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea failed.&quot;\n\nBruford and Wetton next asked guitarist Robert Fripp to reform King Crimson. When \nFripp eventually declined, Bruford and Wetton decided that each would bring in a \nmusician of his choice to form a new band. Wetton brought in keyboardist/violinist \nEddie Jobson, whom Wetton knew from his work with Roxy Music in 1976 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;stealing&quot; \nhim from Frank Zappa. Bruford recruited guitarist Allan Holdsworth (formerly of \nSoft Machine and Gong) who had played guitar on Bruford's 1977 debut solo album, \nFeels Good to Me.\n\nU.K. released their self-titled debut album in 1978 and followed it with a supporting \ntour. Following two lengthy American tours (JuneÃ¢â‚¬â€œOctober 1978), Wetton and Jobson \ndecided to fire Holdsworth over musical differences and Bruford chose to depart as \nwell. Bruford soon formed jazz rock fusion group Bruford and invited Holdsworth to \njoin him.\n\nTrio line-up\n\nAfter the departure of Bruford and Holdsworth, U.K. did not bring in another \nguitarist, instead becoming a trio with drummer Terry Bozzio (another one-time \nFrank Zappa band member). They recorded the studio album Danger Money, released in \nMarch 1979, and spent much of that year touring North America as opening act for \nJethro Tull. The album spawned a minor hit single, &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, which reached \nnumber 67 on the UK charts.[5] A live album, Night After Night, was recorded in \nJapan that Spring and released in September. Following a final European tour in \nDecember 1979, and in spite of plans to record a new studio album in America in \nMarch 1980, U.K. disbanded as Jobson and Wetton had different ideas on how the \nband should develop. Jobson wanted UK to go on with more long instrumental pieces, \nwhile Wetton thought that performing shorter songs was a better idea. Jobson stated \nthat one song in particular was the reason of the band to disband: &quot;When Will You \nRealize?&quot;, a non-LP B-side (to date still unavailable on CD) featured on the \n&quot;Night After Night&quot; single, which Wetton would re-record (with slightly different \nlyrics) in 1980 on his solo album Caught In The Crossfire.\n\nAftermath\n\nJobson worked with Jethro Tull on the album A and went on to a solo career. Wetton, \nfollowing the recording of his solo album Caught In The Crossfire (Summer 1980) \nand a brief stint with Wishbone Ash (OctoberÃ¢â‚¬â€œDecember 1980), eventually left E.G. \nRecords to sign with Geffen Records and ex-Yes manager Brian Lane and started \nAsia with Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and Geoffrey Downes. Bozzio formed Missing \nPersons with his then-wife Dale Bozzio, guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and bassist \nPatrick O'Hearn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all four also from line-ups with Zappa. Holdsworth and Bozzio \nplayed together in HoBoLeMa almost three decades later.\n\nLegacy project\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Jobson and Wetton worked together on a proposed U.K. reunion \nalbum, also recording contributions by Bruford, Tony Levin, Steve Hackett and \nFrancis Dunnery. When Wetton departed, &quot;Legacy&quot; became an Eddie Jobson solo project\n, with Wetton replaced on lead vocals by Aaron Lippert. However, Jobson eventually \nabandoned the project. Three tracks intended for it found their way onto Voices of \nLife, a compilation by Bulgarian Women's Choir organised by Jobson.\n\nUKZ and reunion\n\nIn October 2007, Jobson announced a new band, UKZ, with Lippert and former King \nCrimson bassist/guitarist Trey Gunn among others, which released an EP called \n&quot;Radiation&quot; in March 2009. In late 2009, Jobson and Wetton both talked about a \npossible reunion of U.K. A U.K. reunion tour in February/March 2010 with Jobson, \nWetton, Marco Minnemann on drums (from UKZ) and Greg Howe (Victor Wooten, Vitalij \nKuprij, Michael Jackson) on guitar was described to promoters, but not confirmed by \nWetton.\n\nWetton and Jobson performed three concerts in Poland in November 2009 as part of \nJobson's Ultimate Zero (U-Z) project. The line-up also featured Marco Minnemann \n(drums), Greg Howe (guitar) and Tony Levin (stick). They performed music from UK \nand King Crimson. A CD compiled from various U-Z performances from 2009, including \nmultiple tracks from the Polish shows, has been released.\n\nIt was announced on 11 February 2011, and later confirmed by John Wetton on his \nwebsite, that U.K. were to play two shows in Japan on 15 and 16 April 2011. The \nline-up was Jobson, Wetton, Alex Machacek, and Marco Minnemann. Wetton's comment \nwas &quot;I think you can drop the 'Z', now&quot;. US dates, including a show in San Francisco, \nwere also announced and performed in April 2011. A DVD called &quot;Reunion: Live in \nTokio&quot; was culled from these shows and officially released in 2013.\n\nU.K. have then reformed with Wetton, Jobson and Bozzio for an American tour in 2012.\nThe line-up for the subsequent European tour, other than Jobson and Wetton as usual, \nincluded also drummer Gary Husband and guitarist Alex Machacek who had already played \nwith Jobson on the &quot;Radiation&quot; EP by UKZ.\n\nIn 2013, U.K. did an &quot;Azure Seas&quot; tour with Bozzio on drums and Machacek on guitar, \nand an East Coast tour with Virgil Donati replacing Bozzio. On 8th November of the \nsame year, the band did also a special concert performance of their two studio \nalbums in Kawasaki, in Japan. The drummer for that special concert was Marco Minneman.\n\nU.K. have announced their appearance in the 2014 edition of &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot;. \nThe line-up will include Jobson, Wetton, Machacek and Donati.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797a713d84158a4cf7d96df81652dbc1587cde2a","amp;dn":"U.K.+Discography+1978-1999+2LPs+24-192+1LP+24-96+1CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797a713d84158a4cf7d96df81652dbc1587cde2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,122,113,61,132,21,138,76,247,217,109,248,22,82,219,193,88,124,222,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
