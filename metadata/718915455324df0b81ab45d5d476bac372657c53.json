It's also a fascinating document of the band's history. They began life as Syd Barrett's phantasmagoric plaything before clasping the wings of Icarus and ascending toward the sun on an epic space-rock odyssey, eventually turning left once they reached the dark side of the moon and burning up on reentry, crash-landing on every earthlings' home hi-fi. And it's all here--30 years of the Floyd's awesome back catalog trimmed down to two handsome CDs. It's worth remembering that, despite a fondness for pyrotechnics, Pink Floyd were never a prog-rock band. Sure, some of their songs are a bit long, and they never released singles (at least not for 11 years), but the same could be said for Led Zeppelin. Clinically devoid of the faux-classical overtures and vainglorious musicianship of that era, Pink Floyd were a pole apart; Meddle's epic maritime tone poem &quot;Echoes&quot; remains the Floyd's apogee. But here, on this collection, &quot;the albatross&quot; which &quot;hangs motionless upon the air&quot; has had its wings clipped--seven full minutes are missing, but you'd never be able to tell. The sonar bleeps, the screeching seagulls, the howling winds are all retained, and whoever wielded the editorial axe, Eugene, did so carefully.\n\nDISC 01 \n\n[01] Astronomy Domine \n[02] See Emily Play \n[03] The Happiest Day of Our Lives \n[04] Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) \n[05] Echoes \n[06] Hey You \n[07] Marooned \n[08] The Great Gig in the Sky \n[09] Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \n[10] Money \n[11] Keep Talking \n[12] Sheep \n[13] Sorrow \n\n\tDISC 01 - Play Time - 01h:16m:45s\n\nDISC 02 \n\n[01] Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-7) \n[02] Time \n[03] The Fletcher Memorial Home \n[04] Comfortably Numb \n[05] When the Tigers Broke Free \n[06] One of These Days \n[07] Us And Them \n[08] Learning to Fly \n[09] Arnold Layne \n[10] Wish You Were Here \n[11] Jug Band Blues \n[12] High Hopes \n[13] Bike \n\n\tDISC 02 - Play Time - 01h:18m:31s\n\n\n\t\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 02h:35m:16s\n\t\nTotal File Size \t\t-  371mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\t\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320  kbps\n\t\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\t\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\t\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\t\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\t\nRelease Date\t\t- 05 November 2001\n\t\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\t\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.pinkfloyd.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk \n\t\t\t- http://www.sydbarrett.com \n\t\n\n\t\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\t\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718915455324df0b81ab45d5d476bac372657c53","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Echoes%3B+The+Best+Of+-+Pink+Floyd+-+371mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718915455324df0b81ab45d5d476bac372657c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,137,21,69,83,36,223,11,129,171,69,213,212,118,186,195,114,101,124,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
