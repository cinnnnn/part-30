Alongside of this, we focus on the tattoo lifestyle and all it contains, coverage from the international convention scene, art features from those who embrace the tattoo ethic or find inspiration within it, reader profiles, news, reviews, competitions, letters and every issue also comes with a free supplement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d8a45668f8319c93cf5e6f16ea0efc557fbc3c","amp;dn":"Skin+Deep+Tattoo+%28UK%29+July+2013.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d8a45668f8319c93cf5e6f16ea0efc557fbc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,216,164,86,104,248,49,156,147,207,94,111,22,234,14,252,85,127,188,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
