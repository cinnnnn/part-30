Where did the word &quot;Trinity&quot; come from? What does the Bible say about this doctrine, directly and indirectly? Is God three-in-one-in-three? Is the Holy Spirit a person in the same sense as the Father and Son? \n\nThese and more questions are addressed with an in-depth examination of every central Scripture to the teaching. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (John 17:3)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2254b34a968b8ec56e8bac1c43f2760bf07628","amp;dn":"The+Trinity+-+Fact+or+Fiction%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2254b34a968b8ec56e8bac1c43f2760bf07628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,34,84,179,74,150,139,142,197,110,139,172,28,67,242,118,11,240,118,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
