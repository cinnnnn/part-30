At the climax\nof The Vikings, there is a to-the-death fight between the two main\nprotagonists; and from the first sword-stroke to the last, there is\nnot a single line of dialogue spoken. So? A modern film would have\none-liners peppered throughout the combat...and it would feel FAKE.\n\nVideo Source ....: Region 1 widescreen NTSC\nVideo Codec .....: x264, CQ16, FRFun7, LimitedSharpenFaster, MVDegrain3\nAudio Codec .....: Lame MP3 Mono 96Kbps ...

I too saw this movie as a young kid in the 50's and I loved it then. I went and saw it every time it was rereleased in the theaters. Viewing it on video 40 years later it has lost none of its luster. Kirk Douglas gives an outstanding performance as Einar. Ernest Borgnine should be the prototype of all future viking performances. Excellent supporting cast in Frank Thring and James Donald. Everything about this movie is excellent including the musical score, the scenery, the story line, the makeup. This film gives a true picture of Viking savagery and love of life and war. I do not want to give away any of the plot so just rent this movie you will not be disappointed.
