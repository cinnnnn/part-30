Only in Dreams is a much more fully formed and real sounding record that makes a huge leap from the bedroom to the studio, and could leave some of the bands original fans shaking their heads at some of the changes the bands leader Dee Dee has made. Instead of recording by herself, she formed a regular band and trusts them to play and sing with her throughout. She also sings with a newfound confidence and strength, so instead of burying her vocals in the murky mix, they are out front now. The albums producers, Richard Gottehrer and Sune Rose Wagner, put the focus squarely on Dee Dees voice, dialing back the guitar noise and fattening the sound of the rhythm section. Not surprisingly, it sounds like a record made by a full band playing together, and miles more together seeming than Dee Dees early work. The songs, too, are much more real, focusing on her mothers recent passing and the heartache brought on by conflicting touring schedules that kept her apart from her husband for much of the time she was writing songs for the album. Shes not an incredibly deep lyricist, but her plain-spoken emotion hits hard at times, especially when delivered in her tough and tender vocals.\n\nReleased: September 27, 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~980 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
