Drawn in a decidedly beautiful fashion, reminiscent of Richard Scarry and Lewis Trondheim, Renier has given us a fully-realized and compellingly adventurous narrative, at once both achingly naive and profoundly worldly. This tightly crafted graphic novel is the real deal, and will charm your socks off.\n\n&quot;Spiral-Bound is a lush magical landscape. It rekindles the quintessential childhood experience -- of exploring a mysterious new neighborhood street, or cozying up in a favorite tree-fort or secret hangout -- and revels in the details. It reminds us of the joy of discovery, and of finding oneself.&quot; -- Craig Thompson, Creator of Blankets\n\n&quot;Aaron's great drawings and strong story is just what this world needs. Especially now, because I have kids and I'd rather move to an igloo at the North Pole than raise them in a world without good comic books.&quot; -- Tony Millionaire, Author of Sock Monkey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db00d2cac5eca9807d98f45ee8f189a55efcb229","amp;dn":"Aaron+Renier+-+Spiral-Bound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db00d2cac5eca9807d98f45ee8f189a55efcb229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,0,210,202,197,236,169,128,125,152,244,94,232,241,137,165,94,252,178,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
