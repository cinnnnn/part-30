I did not scan or create this file, but I am redistributing it so that others may enjoy it.\n\nIf you find any of the other books in the series, let me know in the comments and I will add them.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ac334d344f2fc03f702e69fb3b2178be070a37a","amp;dn":"Nintendo+Worlds+of+Power+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ac334d344f2fc03f702e69fb3b2178be070a37a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,195,52,211,68,242,252,3,247,2,230,159,179,178,23,139,224,112,163,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
