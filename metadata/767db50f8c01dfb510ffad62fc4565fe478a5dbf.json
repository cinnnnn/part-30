Spurred into action by the sight of her enormous white knickers billowing on the clothesline, she created the hugely successful blog &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Dietgirl.&quot; Hiding behind her Lycra-clad, roly-poly alter-ego, her transformation from couch potato to svelte goddess began.\n\nToday, eight thousand miles, seven years, and 175 pounds later, the gloriously gorgeous Shauna is literally half the woman she used to be. Hysterically funny and heart-wrenchingly honest, The Amazing Adventures of Dietgirl includes travel tales from Australia to Paris to Red Square, plus romance when she meets the man of her dreams in a Scottish pub. This is the uplifting true story of a young woman who defeated her demons and conquered her cravings to become a real-life superhero to inspire us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:767db50f8c01dfb510ffad62fc4565fe478a5dbf","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Adventures+of+Dietgirl+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"767db50f8c01dfb510ffad62fc4565fe478a5dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,125,181,15,140,1,223,181,16,255,173,98,252,69,101,254,71,138,93,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
