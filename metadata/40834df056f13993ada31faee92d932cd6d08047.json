The band was formed in the winter of 2005 by Alex and Mr. Halkias and few months later Tassos joined the band. As a result the debut demo CD &quot;Get the pleasure back&quot; was released in 2008.\n\nOn June of 2009 the first singer parted ways with the band due to various disagreements and was immediately replaced by Jim, one month later. The overall result was sicker and faster, with a tighter and harsher sound. On February of 2011 &quot;Royal Hate&quot; EP was released. 8 months later Ntinos joined the band and the line-up was completed.\n\nThrough these years the band performed several times in many gigs and fests all around, giving them the opportunity to share the stage with local bands such as: Lucky Funeral, Planet Of Zeus, Need, Beyond Perception, Echidna, Bewized, Harsh Demise, Dark Vision, Building Chaos and many more... They were one of the supporting acts for: The Lumberjack Feedback (FR), Purify (FR) and Since Yesterday (TR) and also performed at Hotel de La Musique, in Roubaix, with UNSU (FR) and The Ape King (FR).\n\nAt the moment Razor's Edge are writing new material.
