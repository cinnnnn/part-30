He spent the '50s oscillating between South and North, and worked with Hooker in Detroit for a while before settling in Chicago. Davis became a living landmark on Maxwell Street;\nHis '60s recordings didn't translate into wider performing opportunities, and when festival bookers finally woke up in the late'80s, his revived career was sadly abbreviated.\nLike Hooker, his one-time neighbour and teacher, Davis played modal, one-chord blues, and even though he was a 'genius loci' of the famous Chicago flea market, his '60s solo recordings are essentially unmodified Delta Blues.\nMore than two decades on, Davis was still an energetic performer, whether alone or with intermittent assistance from harp and drums. His singing had become more extrovert and less brooding, and his acoustic guitar work, though always rhythmically secure, is something very turbulent.\nThis album is not at the level of Davis's earlier work, but its unpretentious enthusiasm is very winning.\n\n\nFor those of you that don't know, the significance of the album title\ncan be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Street&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a5f066b41dee86f39e19be6266334c2898297ca","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Jimmy+Davis+-+Maxwell+Street","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a5f066b41dee86f39e19be6266334c2898297ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,95,6,107,65,222,232,111,57,225,155,230,38,99,52,194,137,130,151,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
