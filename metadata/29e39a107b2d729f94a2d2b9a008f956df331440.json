After a discussion of the available silicone implants and anesthetic management, the various techniques that may be used in body sculpting are carefully described in a series of chapters focusing on augmentation of the biceps, triceps, pectorals, buttocks, hip/thigh, calf, and quadriceps. Potential complications are identified for each of the procedures and clear guidance is provided on how to avoid them. The book will enable the surgeon to gain a sound understanding of the different body sculpting techniques and when they are applicable. It is intended both for students/beginners and for experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e39a107b2d729f94a2d2b9a008f956df331440","amp;dn":"Body+Sculpting+with+Silicone+Implants+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e39a107b2d729f94a2d2b9a008f956df331440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,227,154,16,123,45,114,159,148,162,210,185,160,8,249,86,223,51,20,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
