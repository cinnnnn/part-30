My name is Casey Kasem and the countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is the current single by the only British super-group to continue making the charts for more than 10 years after they first hit, without a change in membership.\n\nCasey tells about the first song to hit number 1 on both the pop and soul charts, by a man who cried his way to success.\n\nThere is a song by the first solo artist in the rock era to hit the top 40 with two completely different arrangements of the same song, and released more than a decade apart.\n\nCasey also answers the questions:\n\nHas there ever been a time when all the top 10 songs were by female artists?\n\nHas there ever been a week where no new songs have debuted into the top 40?\n\nWhat male singer and what female singer have had the longest running chart records?\n\nAnd a listener wants to know which motion picture soundtrack album has spent the most weeks on the LP chart. Casey says that album was written by the same two composers who also wrote the albums in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, and gives the details.\n\n40:    Slow Ride - Foghat\n39:    Golden Years - David Bowie\n38:    Theme From &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; - Rhythm Heritage        \n37:    Paloma Blanco - George Baker Selection     \n36:    Squeeze Box - The Who     \n35:    Let's Live Together - Road Apples    \n34:    Let It Shine - Olivia Newton-John\n33:    Hurricane (Part 1) - Bob Dylan\n32:    Part Time Love - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n31:    Nights On Broadway - The Bee Gees\n30:    Sky High - Jigsaw\n29:    Fly, Robin, Fly - Silver Convention    \n28:    Somewhere In The Night - Helen Reddy\n27:    Baby Face - The Wing &amp; A Prayer Fife &amp; Drum Corps\n26:    For The Love Of You - The Isley Brothers\n25:    Wake Up Everybody - Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes\n24:    Winners And Losers - Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds\n23:    Love Hurts - Nazareth\n22:    Breaking Up Is Hard To Do - Neil Sedaka\n21:    Over My Head - Fleetwood Mac\n20:    Love Machine (Part 1) - The Miracles\n19:    Let's Do It Again - The Staple Singers\n18:    Evil Woman - The Electric Light Orchestra\n17:    50 Ways To Leave Your Lover - Paul Simon\n16:    Fly Away - John Denver\n15:    Rock And Roll All Night Long (Live Version) - Kiss\n14:    You Sexy Thing - Hot Chocolate\nExtra: Teen Angel - Mark Denning\n13:    Sing A Song - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n12:    Country Boy (You've Got Your Feet In L.A.) - Glen Campbell\n11:    Walk Away From Love - David Ruffin\n10:    Times Of Your Life - Paul Anka\n9:    Love To Love You Baby - Donna Summer\n8:    That's The Way (I Like It) - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n7:    I Love Music (Part 1) - The O'Jay's\n6:    Fox On The Run - Sweet\n5:    Saturday Night - The Bay City Rollers\n4:    Love Rollercoaster - Ohio Players\n3:    Theme From &quot;Mahogany&quot; - Diana Ross\n2:    I Write The Songs - Barry Manilow\n1:    Convoy - C.W.
