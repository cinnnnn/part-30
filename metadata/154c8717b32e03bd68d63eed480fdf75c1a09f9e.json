He was better than ever! So I decided to upload the Asylum CD's. Here's no.1! Please seed.\n\n\nGary Numan - Asylum 1\n\nA Japanese 4-CD collection, that compiles The early Albums: The Plan, Tubeway Army, Replicas and The Pleasure Principle, along with B-sides, singles, outtakes and cuts from Living Ornaments '79 and Living Ornaments '80 (the bulk of the latter two being released as Asylum 3). ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exhaustive, with two booklets, containing lyrics and photos galore. For the Numan-Fan, an impressively compact way to gather the early material together, beautifully mastered and presented.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
