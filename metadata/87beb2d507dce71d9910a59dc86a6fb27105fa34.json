Bachir Attar and I talked about this music,\nwich came from Persia to Morocco but wich I feel also has a direct connection with Indian music. I recorded the musicians performing in Jajouka over several nights, keeping the technology to a minimum so they would feel relaxed and their music flow naturally. Then Bachir came to London to work in my studio. Here we tried to capture the energy of the moment while, at the same time, taking the freedom to take the music further without taking away the spirit. I've never imagined the music would come out like this, but it works, and I feel we've achieved a great record.&quot; \nTalvin Singh\n\nMaster Musicians of Jajouka:\nBachir Attar\nMustapha Attar\nHadj Mohamed Attar\nMohamed Attar Larbi\nAmin Attar\nTahir Boukzar\nAbdullah Boukzar\nAbdullah Attar\nAbdullah Attar Sandoui\nAli Rtoubi\nMoktar Gajhdal\nAhmed Elhamdi\n\nProduced by Talvin Singh\n\n01 Up To The Sky, Down To The Earth\n\n   Bachir Attar: Horn\n   Mustapha Attar: Bendir\n   Talvin Singh: Tabla, percussion, vocoder, keyboards\n   Rony Barrak: Percussion\n   Storms: Bass\n   Brad Somatik: Vocoder\n\n\n02 The Truth Forever\n\n   Master Musicians of Jajouka\n\n\n03 Searching For Passion\n\n   Bachir Attar: Horn\n   Talvin Singh: Tabla, atmospheres\n\n\n04 Taksim\n\n   Master Musicians of Jajouka\n\n\n05 You Can Find The Feeling\n\n   Master Musicians of Jajouka\n   Talvin Singh: Drums, keyboards, programming\n   Rony Barrak: Percussion\n   Brad Somatik: Keyboards, programming\n\n\n06 The Blessing For The World From God Only\n\n   The Women of the Attar family of Jajouka\n\n\n07 Jamming In London\n\n   Bachir Attar: Horn\n   Talvin Singh: Drums\n   Cleveland Watkiss: Vocoder\n   Rony Barrak: Percussion\n   Storms: Bass\n   Micke Walter: Record scratching\n   Brad Somatik: Keyboards\n   Byron Wallen: Conch shell\n\n\n08 The House Of Baraka\n\n   Master Musicians of Jajouka\n\n\n09 Above The Moon\n\n   Bachir Attar: Horn\n   Talvin Singh: Keyboards, programming\n   Micke Walter: Record scratching\n   Brad Somatik: Programming\n\n\n10 The Magic Of Peace\n\n   Bachir Attar: Flute\n   Brad Somatik: Keyboards, programming, ambient percussion\n\n\n11 The Magic Of Peace (Remix by D.B.A.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87beb2d507dce71d9910a59dc86a6fb27105fa34","amp;dn":"Master+Musicians+of+Jajouka+feat.+Bachir+Attar+%28re-tagged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87beb2d507dce71d9910a59dc86a6fb27105fa34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,190,178,213,7,220,231,29,153,16,165,157,200,106,111,178,113,5,250,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
