It features every extant note Parker recorded for the Verve label as well as his appearances at Jazz at the Philharmonic. Parker recorded for Verve primarily in the last five years of his life, a period during which, besides playing with his famous quintet, he experimented with strings, Afro-Cuban jazz and mixed chorus. Among the albums produced during ParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Verve years were Bird &amp; Diz, Charlie Parker with Strings, and Swedish Schnapps.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    Original 10 CD release Bird: The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve, 1990 (Verve)\n\nDisc: 5\n\n1-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dancing In The DarkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:19\n2-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out Of NowhereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:06\n3-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“LauraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:57\n4-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“LauraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n5-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“East Of The SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n6-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“They Can't Take That Away From MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n7-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easy To LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n8-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'm In The Mood For LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n9-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'm In The Mood For LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n10- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'll Remember AprilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 1 Alternate take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n11- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'll Remember AprilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 False start) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ :10\n12- Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'll Remember AprilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 (Take 2) Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n13- Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Is This Thing Called Love?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:54\n14- Ã¢â‚¬Å“April In ParisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n15- Ã¢â‚¬Å“RepetitionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:49\n16- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easy To LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n17- Ã¢â‚¬Å“RockerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n18- Ã¢â‚¬Å“CelebrityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:34\n19- Ã¢â‚¬Å“BalladeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n20- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Afro-Cuban Jazz SuiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17:11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861e93a47d8a181b0d43fcb7f323932e107fe85e","amp;dn":"Bird+-+The+Complete+Charlie+Parker+on+Verve+vol.+5+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861e93a47d8a181b0d43fcb7f323932e107fe85e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,30,147,164,125,138,24,27,13,67,252,183,243,35,147,46,16,127,232,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
