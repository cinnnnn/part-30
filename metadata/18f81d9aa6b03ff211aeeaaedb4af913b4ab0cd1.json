Some kind of subtitle that \nmentioned the yin and yang of life would have made it perfect because the \ntracks here are as inclined to paradoxes as the man himself and offer just as \nfew excuses. If you want insight into how a man justifies making family fun \nmovies by day and hardcore rap by night, the only answer offered is that \nyou grow up in this cruel world and you deal any way you know how, \nsomething that drives the great &quot;Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It.&quot; This key track \nmay not be &quot;fair and balanced,&quot; but it's honest and revealing as Cube \nembraces what he wants from the good -- a literate life that damns those \nwho &quot;read your first book in the penitentiary&quot; -- and the commonly accepted \nbad as he attacks Oprah and everyone else who has a problem with hardcore \nrap using the &quot;N&quot; word. The 187 in &quot;Why Me?&quot; could be a metaphor for the \nattacks from Cube's detractors (&quot;You want to take the life God handed to \nme/Send it back to him 'cuz you ain't a fan of me&quot;) while &quot;Jack in the Box&quot; \nsuggests he's already won the war with &quot;Fool, I'm the greatest/You just the \nlatest/I'm loved by your grandmamma/And your babies.&quot; The album's guiding \nprinciple, &quot;only thing I expect is self-check,&quot; is dropped in &quot;Get Money, Spend \nMoney, No Money,&quot; but the great news is that all these standoffish and \nself-serving rhymes are written with that whipsmart wit and sit on a bed of \nwonderfully minimal beats from lesser knowns like Young Fokus and Emile. The \nonly time things sound slick are when an Eddie Kendricks sample meets Angie \nStone's vocals on &quot;Hood Mentality,&quot; or when the so-big-in-2008 Young Jeezy \nshows up for the disappointing and out of place &quot;I Got My Locs On.&quot; The \nbombastic intro and interludes with Keith David could go too, but otherwise \nthis no-answers, gritty ego trip will satisfy his fans while pushing everyone \nelse away even further.\n\nAlbum Review by allmusic.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info:\n\nRipped &amp; Uploaded By elspoon696!\nThis Upload Is Made Of Major Fukken Win!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f81d9aa6b03ff211aeeaaedb4af913b4ab0cd1","amp;dn":"Ice+Cube+-+2008+-+Raw+Footage+Special+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f81d9aa6b03ff211aeeaaedb4af913b4ab0cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,248,29,154,166,176,63,242,17,174,234,174,219,74,249,19,180,171,12,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
