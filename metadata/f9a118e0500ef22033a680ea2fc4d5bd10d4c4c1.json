In all his travels, Colonel Tyrone Rycroft has never encountered a woman as breathtaking, alluring, and inscrutably mysterious as the bewitching Synnovea. But his selfless bravery has drawn him into peril - and into an inescapable web of intrigue and seduction.\nIn an opulent and treacherous imperial court, the proud, headstrong lady's dashing champion has become a pawn in a dangerous game of power and influence - and only his great courage and wits will enable him to survive it. But Rycroft's enflamed desire will not let him escape to the safety of his own world - not until his dream is realized, and the enigmatic, highborn beauty has given herself to him freely, honestly, and forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a118e0500ef22033a680ea2fc4d5bd10d4c4c1","amp;dn":"Forever+in+your+Embrace+-+Kathleen+Woodiwiss.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a118e0500ef22033a680ea2fc4d5bd10d4c4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,161,24,224,80,14,242,32,51,166,128,234,47,196,213,189,16,212,196,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
