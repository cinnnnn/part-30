Godrea is equally proficient on guitar, piano, and violin, and her home recordings found an audience on the Internet, spawning numerous covers recorded by adoring fans and posted on various social websites. Her notorious D.I.Y. work ethic (she sold 15,000 albums independent of a label), which resulted in packed houses and the production of her 2007 full-length debut In Your Dreams, eventually landed her a deal with Fat Cat Records. Her debut for the label, Moenie &amp; Kitchi, arrived in 2008, followed by Leche in 2010.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9347680e3fcef64f68938a6aa8467ac31e894d63","amp;dn":"Gregory+and+the+Hawk+-+Discography+%281998-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9347680e3fcef64f68938a6aa8467ac31e894d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,71,104,14,63,206,246,79,104,147,138,106,168,70,122,195,30,137,77,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
