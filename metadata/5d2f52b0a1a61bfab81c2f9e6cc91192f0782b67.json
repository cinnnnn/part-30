CD1 features the original stereo &amp; mono mixes of the album remastered at Abbey Road. This is the first time that the mono mix has been available in any format since the late '60s. CD2 features the singles, unreleased stereo mixes, the legendary unreleased single Ã¢â‚¬ËœLondon Bye Ta-TaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plus 5 previously unreleased tracks from John PeelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BBC Top Gear radio program December 1967.\n\nAfter a few years of cutting R&amp;B covers and shouty Beatle/Who knock-offs, David Bowie graduated to the sort of dizzying musical experimentation which was soon to make him the stuff of legend. DAVID BOWIE shows a Bowie far removed from of Davie Jones the King Bees or Manish Boys, well on his way to the eclectic luminary status he was soon to achieve. DAVID BOWIE is a surprisingly sprawling affair--composed entirely by the 19-year old Bowie, it reflects a drastic movement from the imitative, R&amp;B-tinged early efforts to a staggering musical complexity and often-abstract poetic wordplay.\n\nEmbracing the hyper-dramatic efforts of then-man-about-town Anthony Newley (&quot;Uncle Arthur,&quot; &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger,&quot;) Bowie works in bizarre, lyrical dreamscapes which must have made the young Robyn Hitchcock swoon--namely the stand-out arpeggiated guitar and medieval melodic tone of &quot;Come And Buy My Toys.&quot; Soon enough, the cheeky musical theater atmosphere would disappear, and a parade of successive reincarnations would continue to redefine popular music for decades to come.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01.
