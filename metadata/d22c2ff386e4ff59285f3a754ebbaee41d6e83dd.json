Her vocal provess soon started changing the band's stylistic directions, compositions merging challenging and adventurous instrumental sequences with accessible and catchy vocal passages a direct result of her influence on events. The addition of Katinka Kleijn (cello) further expanded the band's musical canvas, and when Krahn decided to opt out, young and talented guitarist Jim Tashjian proved to be the final piece of the puzzle District 97 needed to finalize their stylisitc search.\n\nDistrict 97 signed to Laser's Edge Records in May 2010, and their debut album Hybrid Child was released in September the same year.\n\nThis is their 2nd album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trouble with machinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nNobody knows what Ã¢â‚¬Å“progressive rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ really means, - this is rock jazz at itÃ‚Â´s best. They donÃ‚Â´t sound like any other band, but (not only) King Crimson fans should like it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22c2ff386e4ff59285f3a754ebbaee41d6e83dd","amp;dn":"District+97+-+Trouble+With+Machines+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22c2ff386e4ff59285f3a754ebbaee41d6e83dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,44,47,243,134,228,255,89,40,95,58,117,78,187,174,228,29,110,131,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
