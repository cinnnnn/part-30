These manipulations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ingrained in the social fabric not because domination is everywhere and nowhere, but because the institutions of domination create rules, laws, mores and customs that enforce such manipulations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ create a logic of submission, an often unconscious tendency to justify resignation and subservience in one&amp;#039;s everyday relations in the world. For this reason, it is necessary for those who are serious about developing an anarchist insurrectional project to confront this tendency wherever it appears ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in their lives, their relationships and the ideas and practices of the struggles in which they participate. Such a confrontation is not a matter of therapy, which itself partakes of the logic of submission, but of defiant refusal.&quot;\n\nTracks:\n\n1. \tAnti-Copyright\t(0:34)\n2. \tIntroduction\t(1:41)\n3. \tAgainst The Logic Of Submission\t(3:26)\n4. \tA Projectual Life\t(6:00)\n5. \tFree Love\t(6:08)\n6. \tPassionate Friendship\t(4:07)\n7. \tHatred\t(5:40)\n8. \tRealism\t(6:41)\n9. \tBeyond Feminism, Beyond Gender\t(6:58)\n10. \tSecurity Culture And Expansive Living\t(6:28)\n11. \tRevolt, Not Therapy\t(7:56)\n12. \tNeither Intellectualism Nor Stupidity\t(9:15)\n13. \tThe Subversion Of Existence\t(8:27)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb058ed65115e0435d6fcc3bcda567c4f2e5cc4d","amp;dn":"Against+the+Logic+of+Submission+-+Audio+Anarchy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb058ed65115e0435d6fcc3bcda567c4f2e5cc4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,5,142,214,81,21,224,67,93,111,204,59,205,165,103,196,242,229,204,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
