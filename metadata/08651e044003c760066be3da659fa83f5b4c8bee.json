Director Fred Niblo emphasizes the novel's religious aspects\n     more than Wyler (but keeps preaching to a minimum), and creates a\n     chariot race that equals if not surpasses the 1959 remake. Given the\n     more primitive filming techniques of the 1920s, the sequence remains\n     an unqualified marvel, both breathtakingly intense and unnervingly real.\n     Ramon Novarro makes a noble if somewhat stiff Judah, while the hulking\n     Francis X. Bushman exudes evil as Messala. With marvelous restored\n     tinting, brilliant Technicolor sequences, and a rousing score by Carl\n     Davis, this exceptional film proves Ben-Hur really is a story for the \n     ages, and silence can be as thunderous as sound.\n \n                         Director ...........

About all I could do \n     was to make it for the highest movie framerate of 22.037fps. Most\n     of the movie is at that framerate or just under (21.87fps). However,\n     there are some small parts at 19.98fps (the chariot race), and a\n     few small sections at 18.293fps. Those parts have duplicate frames,\n     but I don't think you'll notice them unless going over it frame by\n     frame. This is one of the greatest silent films of all time, and in\n     some ways is even better than the 1959 remake. The sea battle is \n     way better, and the chariot race is at least as good. There's also \n    an excellent Carl Davis score in the original AC3.                                                                      \n          \n                                                                        \n   \n     \n       \n        \n    \n                                              ASCii PROUDLY DONE BY: fumita","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08651e044003c760066be3da659fa83f5b4c8bee","amp;dn":"Ben.Hur.1925.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08651e044003c760066be3da659fa83f5b4c8bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,101,30,4,64,3,199,96,6,107,227,218,101,159,168,63,91,76,139,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
