The 'Community Method' provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the functioning and achievements of the EU.\n\n\nReview\n&quot;A superb analysis of the workings of the EU by the most renowned experts in the field; strongly recommended for research and teaching.&quot;-- Beate Kohler-Koch, Emeritus Professor of Political Science, University of Mannheim, Germany\n \n&quot;The &quot;Community method&quot; has been arguably the single most important substantive European achievement. A timely book revisiting a critical concept for the understanding of the past and possibly for moving ahead in the future.&quot;-- Joseph H.H. Weiler, Joseph Straus Professor of Law and European Union and Jean Monnet Chair at NYU School of Law, USA\n \n&quot;The robustness of the European Union in testing times of course cannot be taken for granted. Yet this volume of thoughtful essays by leading scholars offers strong evidence that the 'Community method' is alive and well and that policy-makers in the EU have found ways of adapting what they do and how they do it to the evolving context in which they operate.&quot;--Helen Wallace, Centennial Professor at the European Institute, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK\nAbout the Author\nRENUAD DEHOUSSE is Jean Monnet Professor of EU Law and Politics at Sciences Po, France, where he also directs the Centre d'ÃƒÂ©tudes EuropÃƒÂ©ennes.
