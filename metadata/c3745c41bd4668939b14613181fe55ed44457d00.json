Available only as an audiobook.\n\nStephen King has forced us to confront our greatest fears.  He has guided us through the depths of our imagination to places we never would have ventured alone.  Now, in Blood and Smoke, he takes us insie a world of yearning and paranoia, isolation and addiction.  It is the world of the smoker.  In this audio-only collection, the now politcally incorrect habit plays a key role in the fates of three different men in three unabridged stories of unfiltered suspense.\n\nLunch at the Gotham Cafe\n1408\nIn the Deathroom\n\nA cartonfull of chills and thrills, Blood and Smoke is classic Stephen King.  The most mesmerizing storyteller of our time is at his inventive and compelling best.\n\nAudiobook read by Stephen King.\n\nEnjoy...Ripley5by5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3745c41bd4668939b14613181fe55ed44457d00","amp;dn":"Blood+and+Smoke+by+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3745c41bd4668939b14613181fe55ed44457d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,116,92,65,189,70,104,147,155,20,97,49,129,254,85,237,68,69,125,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
