Roz and Lil are best friends, and young adults Tom and Ian too. Harold applies for a job in Sydney without telling Roz, and gets it. He expects Roz to move to Sydney with him, but she hesitates. She is irritated, and as a result responsive to start a sexual relationship with Ian initiated by him. Tom discovers this and takes revenge by initiating a sexual relationship with Lil. Now Roz has even more reason to stay, and later Roz and Harold divorce.\n\nTom marries a woman of his own age. Supposedly his sexual relationship with Lil ends here, and Roz decides, out of solidarity but to Ian's regret, to stop their sexual relationship too. Ian has a relationship with a woman of his own age, but is not happy with it. He plans to break up, but he does not after hearing from her that she is pregnant. Later he finds out that Tom and Lil have resumed their sexual relationship. He is so angry that he discloses to the two young women what has been going on. They are so shocked that they break up with the men, with Ian telling his girlfriend that the break-up is final. Ian reconciles with Tom and the mothers, and presumably resumes having sex with Roz.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f98a8761bf2e529d3f87a8c1642d601ff98ef8e","amp;dn":"Adore+DVDRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f98a8761bf2e529d3f87a8c1642d601ff98ef8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,152,168,118,27,242,229,41,211,248,122,140,22,66,214,1,255,152,239,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
