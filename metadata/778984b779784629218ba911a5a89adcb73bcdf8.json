In these eleven stop-motion shorts, you&amp;#039;ll see a lot of mechanical creatures, dismemberment, and calligraphy, set to music. It&amp;#039;s an almost completely visual (and aural) experience, with usually just the skeletons of stories, and whatever symbolism you choose to find. The brothers describe their influences as the animation of Jan Svankmajer (who made the movie Alice), and Eastern-European and South American literature. I think the best time to watch these is when you have a fever, and my favorite is The Comb.\n\nOddly, used copies of this out-of-print DVD are going for hundreds of dollars on Amazon.\n\nA new feature-length, live action movie by the Brothers Quay, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, is supposed to be released soon in the United States, and is already out on DVD in Europe.\n\n\nrecommended software: VLC player (@ videolan.org)\n\n\nBrotheres Quay Collection (1979-93)\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,055,730,616 (0.98 GB on disk)\nRuntime ...............: 2:04:02\nVideo Codec ...........: AVC / H.264\nFrame Size ............: usually 480x382 (aspect ratio varies between films)\nFPS ...................: 24\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1000 kb/s\nAudio Codec ...........: AAC\nSample Rate ...........: 44,100 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 kb/s 2-channel (Stereo) CBR\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039;\n***************************************\n************** FREAKYFLICKS ***********\n***************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778984b779784629218ba911a5a89adcb73bcdf8","amp;dn":"Brothers+Quay+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778984b779784629218ba911a5a89adcb73bcdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,137,132,183,121,120,70,41,33,139,169,17,165,168,154,220,183,59,205,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
