Allen Collins  former \nleadguitar front man in Lynyrd Skynyrd, for those who donÃ‚Â´t know their Rock History. For collectors only. The vocals are low, but in my opinion, a listeneable show. And a piece of history too...\nThe correct date is unknown, but I'm sure someone will provide the right information.\n\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c14d410b611afd3b5f7ab73eba73189ea3dfb2a","amp;dn":"Allen+Collins+Band+-+Live+at+The+Lone+Star+Cafe+1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c14d410b611afd3b5f7ab73eba73189ea3dfb2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,20,212,16,182,17,175,211,181,247,171,115,235,167,49,137,234,61,251,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
