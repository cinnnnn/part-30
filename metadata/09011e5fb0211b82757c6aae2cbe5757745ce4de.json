GEASA here have created a masterpiece of Celtic Pagan Black Metal. The simple riffs underneath are very complex blending and shaping various moods within the constant atmosphere of the album.\n\nI find that every time I listen to this album I change my opinion of it. It is never bad, no matter how much my tastes develop and change this is one album I will always respect and appreciate for its greatness. This album is truly a work of genius.\n\nAs with Black Metal-acts like BURZUM, GEASA have managed to make the seemingly simple nature of the music something much deeper that when discovered with leave you in awe of its genius. Each guitar riff flows from the previous perfectly and combines together in the whole entity of the song to leave you entranced by its magic. The drumming is like that of PRIMORDIAL (same drummer) and it fits perfectly here. The vocals are expressed with a great passion and energy showing convincing emotions that will effect the listener and inflict upon him/her those same emotions.\n\nEach song is great in its own respect. Personally I find it hard to listen to one without the rest as they seem to be perfectly positioned on the album so as to need the surrounding tracks to make them feel complete, this is one of the strange magical things about this album. &quot;Frozen Queen&quot; I think must be mentioned for its energy. This track will have you spellbound and will capture your attention 100% for the 5 minutes and 43 seconds it is on for.\n\nOverall this album is a must for fans of PRIMORDIAL and also for those of unique Black Metal true to its culture and history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/417637&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/417637&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=8233&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=8233&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEAC Lame 3.97 v0 VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09011e5fb0211b82757c6aae2cbe5757745ce4de","amp;dn":"Geasa+-+Angel%5C%27s+Cry+%281999%29+%2AIrish+Pagan%2FBlack+Metal+%28v0+VBR%29%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09011e5fb0211b82757c6aae2cbe5757745ce4de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,1,30,95,176,33,27,130,117,124,106,174,44,190,87,87,116,92,228,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
