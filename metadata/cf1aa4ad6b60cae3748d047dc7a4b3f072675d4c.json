The question remains, though, who killed the Antichrist? Who is the one responsible for his death?\n\nIn The Indwelling, the second half of the seven-year Tribulation period comes to pass with the horrors of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s judgment abounding and the hope of salvation peeking through the devastation.\n\nThe death was as visible as any in history. Millions saw the antichrist die. But prophecy has a lot to say about whether or not he stays that way...\n\nGenre: Futuristic\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Gap DIGITAL &amp; Tyndale House Publishing\nDramatized radio adaptation\nFormat: MP3,\nBit rate: 128kbps mp3 format\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1aa4ad6b60cae3748d047dc7a4b3f072675d4c","amp;dn":"07+-+The+Indwelling+by+Tim+LaHaye%2C+Jerry+B.+Jenkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1aa4ad6b60cae3748d047dc7a4b3f072675d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,26,164,173,107,96,202,227,116,141,4,125,199,164,179,240,114,103,93,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
