Over its decades-long run, the band has left its mark on everything from hardcore and thrash to speed metal and punk-funk. Displaying an incredible level of musicianship, Suicidal Tendencies have emerged as one of the most respected and influential bands of the California punk scene of the 1980s, a fact solidified by bass player Robert Trujillo being hand-picked to replace Jason Newstead in Metallica in 2003.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c82e9c7193342a776561eccbbaf4f5609217976b","amp;dn":"Suicidal+Tendencies+-+Join+The+Army","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c82e9c7193342a776561eccbbaf4f5609217976b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,46,156,113,147,52,42,119,101,97,236,203,186,244,245,96,146,23,151,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
