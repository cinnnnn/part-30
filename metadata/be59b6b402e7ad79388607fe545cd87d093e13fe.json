The story is based on a novel by Carlos Diegues and Antonio Pitanga. Director Antonio Pitanga co-wrote the novel, produced, directed, wrote the screenplay, and plays the lead in this well-received Brazilian film. This is AntÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´nio PitangaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s only movie as a director (although he also plays the main character). HeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s known as one of the great actors of the Brazillian Cinema Novo, staring on films of Glauber Rocha, Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, Caca Diegues and others. His real name is actually AntÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´nio Sampaio, but his role as a character named Pitanga in his first movie &quot;Bahia de Todos os Santos&quot; was so effective that he came to be known as Pitanga.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : D:BT UploadsAntonio Pitanga - Na Boca do Mundo [1978]Na boca do mundo.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.47 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 966 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Bit rate : 1 703 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.285\n      Stream size : 1.27 GiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 195 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n      Language : portuguese\n\nIMDB: tt0261087\n\nPortuguese audio; no subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by patinhofeio33, who should get all the credits.\n\nAntonio Pitanga - Na Boca do Mundo [1978]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be59b6b402e7ad79388607fe545cd87d093e13fe","amp;dn":"Antonio+Pitanga+-+Na+Boca+do+Mundo+%5B1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be59b6b402e7ad79388607fe545cd87d093e13fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,89,182,180,2,231,173,121,56,134,7,254,84,92,216,125,9,62,19,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
