Physically almost unharmed, a shock wace of blinding, all-engulfing hatred and revulsion seared through his mind. Revulsion not just for the bombers but for a world that could produce such horror. And he sought revenge on that world, creating and unleashing a plague. Then, as his plague swept the world, bringing not just death but the mad anarchy of terror, he went on a journey where he was forced to see the awfulness of his own handiwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8575c21d8f9da28a912c21f844af447e3abf8c4f","amp;dn":"Frank+Herbert+-+The+White+Plague+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8575c21d8f9da28a912c21f844af447e3abf8c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,117,194,29,143,157,162,138,145,44,33,248,68,175,68,126,58,191,140,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
