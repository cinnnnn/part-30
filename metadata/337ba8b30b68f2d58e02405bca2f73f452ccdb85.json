Even her own \r\n\r\nbrother Ngor is in love with her. However she is in love with Fara, a poor student who has returned to \r\n\r\nthe village, while the university is on strike. At birth, she had been promised in marriage to \r\n\r\nDiogoye, who went away to work in France. Diogoye, who supplied her parents with many things over the \r\n\r\nyears, has now sent a dowry, and asked that she be married to him in the village in his absence; she \r\n\r\nwould then be sent to France. \r\n\r\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : D:BT DownloadsMOSSANE.1996.LSMOSSANE.1996.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 1 737 Kbps\r\nLength            : 1.24 GiB for 1h 41mn 48s 920ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC\r\nAspect            : 700 x 456 (1.636) at 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117088/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: Wolof\r\nSubtitles: French hardcoded, English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:337ba8b30b68f2d58e02405bca2f73f452ccdb85","amp;dn":"MOSSANE.1996.LS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"337ba8b30b68f2d58e02405bca2f73f452ccdb85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,123,168,179,11,104,242,213,142,2,64,91,202,47,115,244,82,204,219,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
