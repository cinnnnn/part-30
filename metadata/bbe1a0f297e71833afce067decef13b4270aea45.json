It will also help those of you who have a bit of knowledge about Linux and the embedded world and are keen on learning more about the technology. This book will provide you with the skills needed to successfully interact with the Yocto Project components regardless of the fact that you are new to embedded development or an expert.\n\nIn Detail\n\nThis book offers readers an idea of what embedded Linux software and hardware architecture looks like, cross-compiling, and also presents information about the bootloader and how it can be built for a specific board. This book will go through Linux kernel features and source code, present information on how to build a kernel source, modules, and the Linux root filesystem. You'll be given an overview of the available Yocto Project components, how to set up Yocto Project Eclipse IDE, and how to use tools such as Wic and Swabber that are still under development. It will present the meta-realtime layer and the newly created meta-cgl layer, its purpose, and how it can add value to poky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe1a0f297e71833afce067decef13b4270aea45","amp;dn":"Learning+Embedded+Linux+Using+The+Yocto+Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe1a0f297e71833afce067decef13b4270aea45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,225,160,242,151,231,24,51,175,206,6,125,236,239,19,180,39,10,234,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
