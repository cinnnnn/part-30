This is a 1985 demo for Kurt Cobains early band called Fecal Matter. It is super rare and is an early look at songs like Spank Thru and Downer\n\nBand: Fecal Matter (AKA Kurts first band)\nDemo Name: Illiteracy Will Prevail\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 320kbps\n\n\n\nThis is a demo and was originally recorded on a cassette so excuse the quality. Some of the songs don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have names and are labeled Unknown but I have labeled what I know and have included the hand written cover\n\nEnjoy, Comment and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a8d572da0b95c302a5bd02049ba778dd91002f","amp;dn":"Illiteracy+Will+Prevail+%28Cobains+Early+Band+Demo%29+-Back2Ruin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a8d572da0b95c302a5bd02049ba778dd91002f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,168,213,114,218,11,149,195,2,165,189,2,4,155,167,120,221,145,0,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
