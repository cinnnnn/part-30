Written by internationally acclaimed authors, the style of the book is to develop the basic physical principles without obscuring them with excessive mathematics.\n\nThe second edition differs substantially from the first edition, with over 30% new material, including: \n\n    * A new chapter on non-crystalline diffraction - designed to appeal to the large community who study the structure of liquids, glasses, and most importantly polymers and bio-molecules\n    * A new chapter on x-ray imaging - developed in close cooperation with many of the leading experts in the field\n    * Two new chapters covering non-crystalline diffraction and imaging\n    * Many important changes to various sections in the book have been made with a view to improving the exposition\n    * Four-colour representation throughout the text to clarify key concepts\n    * Extensive problems after each chapter \n\nPraise for the previous edition:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe publication of Jens Als-Nielsen and Des McMorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Elements of Modern X-ray Physics is a defining moment in the field of synchrotron radiationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a welcome addition to the bookshelves of synchrotronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“radiation professionals and students alike....
