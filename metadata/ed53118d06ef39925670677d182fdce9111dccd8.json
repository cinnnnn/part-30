Altering the enemyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \npast so as to defeat their present, dealing with a new way of seeing the world. \nIt has parallels to the first time man took to the sky in wartime, biplanes \ngiving a literal new dimension to warfare and a very new way of seeing the \nworld. And so it is here, another dimension to fight in. We meet two different \ngenerations, the fathers and the sons, both fighting the war, in two separate \ntimes. We are told that there are no paradoxes and reading the book seems \npretty simple when you work out the differences between time ships and the \nevents being portrayed. And then the beard comes into play, and you realise \nthere are lies being told.\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed53118d06ef39925670677d182fdce9111dccd8","amp;dn":"The+Red+Wing+%231+%28of+4%29+%5BIMAGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed53118d06ef39925670677d182fdce9111dccd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,83,17,141,6,239,57,146,86,112,103,125,24,47,220,233,17,29,204,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
