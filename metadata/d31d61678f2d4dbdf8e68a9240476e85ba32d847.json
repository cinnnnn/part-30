But what Isis discovers is something other than a menacing entity. The human-like creature offers Isis assurance that he is not a figment of her imagination. Unwilling to accept his avowal, Isis sets his words to contest by asking the entity to prove himself - a dare, he readily welcomes. It is in her dreams that Isis innocently stumbles upon the silent existence of the divine lineage of those that man has long forgotten. In a quaint town, deep in south Texas, this story leads Isis onto the path of impermissible love and captivating life-changing truths. Isis Martin's journey is sure to leave any reader ravenous for more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31d61678f2d4dbdf8e68a9240476e85ba32d847","amp;dn":"Creatura+-+Nelly+Cab.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31d61678f2d4dbdf8e68a9240476e85ba32d847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,29,97,103,143,45,77,189,248,230,138,146,64,71,110,133,186,50,216,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
