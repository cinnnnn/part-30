Turns out it's actually pretty good - maybe you either feel the magic or you don't. One of the rare cases where a remake makes sense and works. Also lots of interesting Los Angeles locations, and Jack Nitzsche takes care of the music (including a nifty re-arrangement of Philip Glass). And plenty of nudity from DIck &amp; Val !\n\nFrom its April 2009 screening at Anthology Film Archives :\n&quot;Given his experimental bent it's surprising that McBride actually thrived in the restructured, corporatized film-industry of the '80s. The best of the batch is the transposition of Godard's Breathless to pastel-and-neon Los Angeles of 1983. French softcore sexpot Valerie Kaprisky replaces Jean Seberg and the Belmondo role goes to Richard Gere. His pelvic-seizuring Benzedrine-bopper, Jesse, is an absurdly conspicuous fugitive who only hotwires vintage rides (including a James Dean Porsche Spyder), learns love from Silver Surfer comics, and almost blends in with Venice Beach murals. McBride's Breathless has been freely maligned, but it's happily audacious in returning Godard's transatlantic serve, and actually gives its female lead an emotional existence beyond fulfilling a femme fatale construct. The stars are rarely uninhibited and tangibly hot for each other, and every element of the movie jams responsively with the soundtrack. I'd rather re-watch it than A bout de souffle about 9 times out of 10.&quot;\n\n\nthanks goes to Leni @ tik","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539efb57941d4501bd4d33f65dc98a1ebe213b63","amp;dn":"Breathless+%281983%29+PAL+DVD5+VIDEO+TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539efb57941d4501bd4d33f65dc98a1ebe213b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,158,251,87,148,29,69,1,189,77,51,246,93,201,138,30,190,33,59,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
