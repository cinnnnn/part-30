I removed the short flashbacks in the museum when The Doctor goes back in time to Rory and little Amy. I just wondered what it would be like without them. I think it works. The flashbacks were just to remind you of what you already saw. I think it's more fun to see the events from the different timeframes instead of jumping back and forth. Anyway, try it if you want. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc9e08434e86de2d7f5283706415069eb7fd621","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2005.S05E13.The.Big.Bang.fanedit.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc9e08434e86de2d7f5283706415069eb7fd621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,201,224,132,52,232,109,226,215,245,40,55,6,65,80,105,235,127,214,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
