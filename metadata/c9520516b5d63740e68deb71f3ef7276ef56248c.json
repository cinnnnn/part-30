They went through a fallow period commercially in the early seventies before coming back with the hit album The Joker and the song of the same name in late 1973, before releasing the band's two most successful studio albums in 1976 and 1977, Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams. In 1978, they released their biggest selling album in North America, Greatest Hits 1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ78, which has been certified 13x multi-platinum in the United States and diamond in Canada. Although the 1981 release Circle of Love was less successful than the two preceding studio albums, the popularity of 1982's Abracadabra, which included the world-wide hit single of the same name, more than made up for it. The band's studio releases became more infrequent at this point, with the biggest gap in albums being between 1993's Wide River and 2010's Bingo!.\n\nThe band's releases have been most successful in North America: two #1 albums in Canada, two #1 singles in the United States and Canada, three multi-platinum awards in the United States, and selling over 24 million albums in the United States alone. The band's most successful singles have been &quot;The Joker&quot;, which peaked in the top 10 of the trade charts of 6 countriesÃ¢â‚¬â€reaching #1 in four, and &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, which made the top 10 in 5 countriesÃ¢â‚¬â€and #1 in two countries. Of the band's albums, 12 have reached the top 40 in the United States and 7 have done the same in Canada.\n\nFLAC\n\nCD\n\n\n1968 - Sailor (Remaster)\n\n1969 - Brave New World\n\n1969 - Your Saving Grace (Remaster)\n\n1970 - Number 5\n\n1971 - Rock Love\n\n1972 - Recall The Beginning...A Journey From Eden\n\n1973 - The Joker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9520516b5d63740e68deb71f3ef7276ef56248c","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band+-+7+Albums+%2868-73%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9520516b5d63740e68deb71f3ef7276ef56248c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,82,5,22,181,214,55,64,230,141,235,113,243,239,114,118,239,86,36,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
