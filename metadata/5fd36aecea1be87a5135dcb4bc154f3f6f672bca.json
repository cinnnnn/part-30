Looking Back, Looking Forward\n\n\n\nIlliteracy, starvation, and disease were the norm.\n\nIn fact, Europe in the year 1000 was one of the world's more stagnant regionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an economically undeveloped, intellectually derivative, and geopolitically passive backwater.\n\nThree short centuries later, all this had changed dramatically. A newly invigorated cluster of European societies revived city life, spawned new spiritual and intellectual movements and educational institutions, and began, for reasons both sacred and profane, to expand at the expense of neighbors who traditionally had expanded at Europe's expense.\n\nThe Revival of Europe\n\nIn this course you examine how and why Europeans achieved this stunning turnaround. By its conclusion, you will be able to describe and analyze the social, intellectual, religious, and political transformations that underlay this midsummer epoch of the medieval world.\n\nBut why were &quot;the Middle Ages&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the period from 1000 to 1300ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so designated?\n\nPetrarch, writing in the 1300s, defined the period of &quot;literary and artistic rot&quot; in Europe after the sack of Rome in 410 A.D. as an &quot;Age of Darkness.&quot; The idea of the Middle Ages originates with Petrarch's concept, even though he did not technically use the term &quot;the Middle Ages&quot; himself. The Latin term &quot;medium aevum&quot; (the Middle Age) first appeared in the 15th century.\n\nThemes and Topics You'll Cover\n\nThe lectures fall into three groups.\n\nThe first eight lectures treat medieval society: the warrior aristocracy of knights, castellans, counts, and dukes; the free and unfree peasants whose work in the fields made the existence of medieval society possible; and the townspeople, both artisans and merchants, who represented the newest arrivals on the medieval scene.\n\nLectures 9 through 16 examine the intellectual and religious history of high medieval Europe. You study monks and the monastic life, charismatic preachers such as Francis of Assisi, and theologians such as Thomas Aquinas. You examine the lives of those who found themselves outside the religious mainstream, especially the heretics and Jews of high medieval Europe.\n\nThe final eight lectures discuss the major political developments and events between 1000 and 1300, including the First Crusade, the Norman Conquest of England, and the granting of Magna Carta.\n\nThe key events, entities, and personalities you will learn about include:\n\n    * the demographic, climatic, and technological changes that set the stage for Europe's resurgence\n    * the three groups (&quot;those who work, those who fight, and those who pray&quot;) who formed the backbone of medieval society\n    * an in-depth look at the renewed world of cities, artisans, merchants, and commercial exchange that shaped the high-medieval scene in crucial ways\n    * the ongoing struggles between popes and emperors\n    * the significance of figures as diverse as William the Conqueror, Pope Gregory VII, Abelard, Emperor Frederick II, King Philip II Augustus of France, Saint Benedict, Bernard of Clairvaux and Hildegard of Bingen\n    * the institutions of knighthood, &quot;feudalism,&quot; the Church and monasticism, the Scholastic university, and the urban guild\n    * the situations of &quot;marginalized&quot; groups such as peasants, urban workingfolk, women, Jews, and heretics.\n\nThe Attention to Detail Makes the Difference in this Course\n\nProfessor Philip Daileader's course is filled with memorable details as he unfolds this story. For example:\n\nEurope's population doubled between 1000 and 1300. Life expectancies were probably not much higher than age 25 around 1000, but closer to 35 by 1300. In addition to the unexplained disappearance of bubonic plague and dry, warm climatic conditions known as the &quot;little optimum,&quot; the most important factors in this growth spurt were simple farming implementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the newly introduced heavy plow and the horse collar. This allowed a growing population to have enough to eat for the first time ever.\n\nThe aristocracy's violence, especially its private wars and robbery and treatment of peasantry, was one of the great social problems of the High Middle Ages. To tame and civilize the warrior aristocracy, medieval clergy devised various methods such as the Peace and Truce of God movements, which granted immunity from noble violence to certain defenseless groups. Such movements were generally ineffective because clerics had to rely on religious sanctions and, ultimately, the nobles' own consciencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½pledges for good behavior were generally forgotten almost immediately.\n\nAround the year 1000, to become a knight one merely had to secure the necessary equipment. The original tournaments for knights were nothing but huge and deadly free-for-alls held in available open areas with no regard for any nearby personal property. Chivalry was invented to diminish this violence. By 1300, the European nobility was a largely hereditary class with specific legal privileges. Nobles proudly proclaimed their bloodlines through coats of arms and family names (which had not existed in 1000). Knighthood was restricted to those who had undergone a specific dubbing ceremony.\n\nThe first books for manners were called &quot;courtesy books&quot; and written by clergy trying to curb the nobility's revolting table manners. Unfortunately, hardly anyone the books were meant for could read, so they were a complete failure.\n\nProfessor Daileader comments on the question: &quot;Why study medieval history?&quot;\n\n&quot;This question might be, and has been, answered in many ways. Let me suggest just one:\n\n&quot;To understand what is truly distinctive about the world in which we live, you need to know what came before.\n\n&quot;The modern world is the product of the medieval world... It is impossible to understand the thoughts and actions of Luther, Galileo, or Voltaire, for example, without understanding the Middle Ages all were very conscious of medieval history, and the medieval period informed what they wrote and did.\n\n&quot;Likewise, in order to understand such important modern events as the French Revolution or the 19th-century unifications of Germany and Italy, one must understand the Middle Ages as well, because these events were informed by the medieval past and were attempts to deal with its legacy.\n\n&quot;Most importantly, I hope that by the end of this course, you will share my own desire to learn and understand more about the Middle Ages, and that you will use this course as a springboard from which to launch your own deeper investigations into medieval history.&quot;\n\nProfessor Daileader is Associate Professor of History at The College of William and Mary. A four-time winner of Harvard's Certificate of Distinction in Teaching, he has also taught at the University of Alabama and The State University of New York at New Paltz.
