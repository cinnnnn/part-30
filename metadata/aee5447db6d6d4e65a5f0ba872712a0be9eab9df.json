It was his custom to dictate each evening a running narrative of the dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s events and, after each battle, to summarize its course and the lessons to be learned from it. He wrote, almost daily, intimate and outspoken letters to his wife in which his private feelings andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after the tide had turnedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½forebodings found expression. To this is added by RommelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son Manfred the story of the field marshallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last weeks and the final day when he was given the choice of an honorable suicide or an ignominious trial for treason. An engrossing human document and a rare look at the mind of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Desert Fox,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Rommel Papers throws an interesting light on the Axis alliance and on the inner workings of HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high command.\nAbout the Author\nCaptain Basil Henry Liddell Hart (1895ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1970) was one of the foremost military theorists of our time.
