Meera\nGul Panag\t.... Zeenat\nShreyas Talpade\t.... Behroopiya\n\nDirector : Nagesh Kukunoor\n\nNagesh Kukunoor?s latest movie ?Dor? is a compelling watch. It is a moving tale of two women ? one who undertakes a long journey to save her love, and another who dares to break the shackles of tradition and choose life as her heart wants it.\n\nLike Kukunoor?s previous movie ?Iqbal?, ?Dor? too is a film on the empowerment of the weak and the oppressed. It is a beautiful tale of love, loss, friendship, and courage to live anew. The film is raw and realistic in essence. And this is the reason why its story is so believable and deeply touching.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a639ab1158a75e388760aa132a965d50cce351","amp;dn":"Dor.2006.Hindi.DVDRip.DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a639ab1158a75e388760aa132a965d50cce351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,166,57,171,17,88,167,94,56,135,96,170,19,42,150,93,80,204,227,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
