Kerre | 2009-05-01 | ISBN: 3540783105 | 220 pages | PDF | 1,8 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nMathematics of Fuzziness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Basic Issues introduces a basic notion of Ã¢â‚¬ËœfuzzinessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and provides a conceptual mathematical framework to characterize \nsuch fuzzy phenomena in Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing. The book systematically presents a self-contained introduction to the essentials of \nmathematics of fuzziness ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy relations, fuzzy numbers, fuzzy algebra, fuzzy measures, fuzzy integrals, and fuzzy topology to \nfuzzy control in a strictly mathematical manner. It contains most of the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ research results in the field of fuzzy set theory and has evolved from the \nauthorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lecture notes to both undergraduate and graduate students over the last three decades. A lot of exercises in each chapter of the book are \nparticularly suitable as a textbook for any undergraduate and graduate student in mathematics, computer science and engineering. \nThe reading of the book will surely lay a solid foundation for further research on fuzzy set theory and its applications. \n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d007e8da84f26f437cedb5115c18785881d2991","amp;dn":"Mathematics+of+Fuzziness+-+Basic+Issues%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d007e8da84f26f437cedb5115c18785881d2991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,0,126,141,168,79,38,244,55,206,219,81,21,193,135,133,136,29,41,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
