Learn how to use this incredibly sophisticated 3D modeling and rendering program to visualize almost anything you can imagine.\r\n\r\nIn this course, author Scott Onstott shows you how to build walls, doors, windows, stairs, railings, moldings, cloth, pottery, furniture, grass, trees, landscapes, and much more, using splines, modifiers, Booleans, and NURBS modeling. You'll also learn to texture-map objects, light them with both direct and indirect illumination, place virtual cameras, render, and animate scenes.\r\nTopics include:\r\nWorking with files and objects from other programs\r\nCreating parametric AEC objects\r\nTracing splines\r\nLathing a 2D profile\r\nDesigning spline-based walls and windows\r\nDeforming objects with modifiers\r\nAttaching, grouping, and compounding\r\nSculpting and painting landscapes\r\nSimulating fabric, grass, and foliage\r\nNURBS modeling\r\nTexture mapping and designing materials\r\nPlacing virtual cameras\r\nRendering images\r\nAnimating a camera along a flight path","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adea7b277dd20046dd4bdd2445d170031ba3b95d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+3ds+Max+for+Design+Visualization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adea7b277dd20046dd4bdd2445d170031ba3b95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,234,123,39,125,210,0,70,221,75,221,36,69,209,112,3,27,163,185,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
