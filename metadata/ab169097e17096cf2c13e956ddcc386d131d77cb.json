In this revealing and powerfully argued book, author Franck Frommer shows us that PowerPointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated ease and efficiency actually mask a profoundly disturbing but little-understood transformation in human communication.\n\nUsing fascinating examples (including the most famous PowerPoint presentation of all: Colin PowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indictment of Iraq before the United Nations), Frommer systematically deconstructs the slides, bulleted lists, and flashy graphics we all now take for granted. He shows how PowerPoint has promoted a new, slippery Ã¢â‚¬Å“grammar,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where faulty causality, sloppy logic, decontextualized data, and seductive showmanship have replaced the traditional tools of persuasion and argument.\n\nHow PowerPoint Makes You Stupid includes a fascinating mini-history of PowerPointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emergence, as well as a sobering and surprising account of its reach into the most unsuspecting nooks of work, life, and education. For anyone concerned with the corruption of language, the dumbing-down of society, or the unchecked expansion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“efficiencyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in our culture, here is a book that will become a rallying cry for turning the tide.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-PowerPoint-Makes-Stupid-Decontextualized/dp/1595587020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332877503&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-PowerPoint-Makes-Stupid-Decontextualized/dp/1595587020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332877503&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab169097e17096cf2c13e956ddcc386d131d77cb","amp;dn":"How+PowerPoint+Makes+You+Stupid%3A+The+Faulty+Causality%2C+Sloppy+Lo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab169097e17096cf2c13e956ddcc386d131d77cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,22,144,151,225,112,150,207,44,19,233,86,221,204,56,109,19,29,119,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
