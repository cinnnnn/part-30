Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the\ntrick.\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nHelp Tomb Raider's famous heroine, Lara Croft, save the world from the forces of evil.\n\nAs the game begins, Lara wakes from a stupor. Recalling what she can of the past few hours, she remembers walking in on a killer after discovering the body of Von Croy, her friend and former mentor. She must make a hasty escape from the authorities who blame her for the crime. Determined to discover the fiend responsible, Lara eventually uncovers an evil plot that could cause the destruction of mankind. If the reincarnation of the &quot;angel of darkness&quot; is allowed to happen, the world is doomed!\n\nThe game environment is set in the somewhat distant future. You'll lead Lara mostly in 3rd person perspective, travelling to various locales in Europe. Explore sewers, cemeteries, warehouses, factories and cities. A multitude of NPCs will be encountered, both in the form of friend as well as foe.\n\nAngel of Darkness introduces new stealth and close-combat moves - ducking, sneaking and hug-the-walls walking. Lara must build her skills by performing action sequences. You'll have her running, dodging, performing flying leaps and platform jumps, shimming along walls and cables, as well as moving boxes and other obstacles around. Advancements are achieved with strategically placed power-ups. Collect weapons and ammunition, artifacts and money.\n\nYou'll also play Kurtis Trent, a new male counterpart, for several &quot;levels&quot;. Although Kurtis gets in Lara's way when she first meets him, he eventually becomes an ally when they realize they are both working towards the same goal.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Character interaction - for the very first time in a Tomb Raider game, Lara has \n  the ability to talk to characters. The choices you make in conversation will \n  affect LaraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s route through the game. \n\n* Take more direct and fluid control over Lara with an entirely new control system \n  and experience new levels of gameplay with hand-to-hand combat, stealth \n  attacks, last chance grabs and more.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media\nisn't working.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8ce370183824bb7e51e6e27e670c1621bc49e6","amp;dn":"Tomb+Raider+Angel+of+Darkness+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8ce370183824bb7e51e6e27e670c1621bc49e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,140,227,112,24,56,36,187,126,81,230,226,126,103,12,22,33,188,73,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
