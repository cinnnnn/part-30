Formed in 1993 by brothers Jamie Roberts (Vocals and Guitar) and Jonathan Roberts (guitars, bass, trumpet, piano). In 1997 they released their debut self-titled album through Cadence. They quickly became popular and began touring with groups like Third Day, Switchfoot and Newsboys. They were also the featured opening act for Petra's &quot;We Need Jesus&quot; tour in 1997. On January 11, 1998, the band was struck by tragedy when their tour bus hit a patch of black ice in route to a concert. Drummer Chris Yeomen was killed and Jon Roberts was left with a shattered pelvis. It was at this time the band considered calling it quits but decided to press on instead. In 1999, the band released their second album entitled Red Revolution. The album was a moderate success and features a remake of the Benny Hester classic &quot;When God Ran&quot;. The band has since broken up, and brothers Jamie and Jonathan currently reside in Los Angeles.\n\n\nLet's remember this Christian Band.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62f871eca01b10cf3e12555db1229dd7712fcba","amp;dn":"Shaded+Red+-+Red+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62f871eca01b10cf3e12555db1229dd7712fcba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,47,135,30,202,1,177,12,243,225,37,85,219,18,41,221,119,18,252,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
