They became popular in southern gospel during the 1950s. Their name was officially changed to the Oak Ridge Boys in the early 1960s, and they remained a gospel-oriented group until the mid-1970s, when they changed their image and concentrated on country music.\n\nThe lineup which produced their most well-known country and crossover hits (such as &quot;Elvira&quot;, &quot;Bobbie Sue&quot;, and &quot;American Made&quot;) consists of Duane Allen (lead), Joe Bonsall (tenor), William Lee Golden (baritone), and Richard Sterban (bass). Golden and Allen joined the group in the mid-1960s, and Sterban and Bonsall joined in the early 1970s. Aside from a seven-year gap (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995) when Golden left the group and was replaced, this lineup has been together since 1973 and continues to tour and record.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b6f6ba3da36a7a62d3b2182c88ddd8d7bd8372","amp;dn":"Oak+Ridge+Boys+-+6+Albums+1983+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b6f6ba3da36a7a62d3b2182c88ddd8d7bd8372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,182,246,186,61,163,106,122,98,211,178,24,44,136,221,216,215,189,131,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
