The first one, &quot;In the Shop,&quot; Malloff uses to discuss saws, chains, and their modification for ripping, the mill, and how it works, how he uses a winch to move the saw through a log, and tools he builds to assist with the job. Section two, &quot;In the Field,&quot; shows how to fell a tree, how to set up the mill, and how to cut lumber. He provides all the basic information and also includes techniques for milling boxheart lumber, quarter sawing, and slab sawing. Part three is for specialty work with specialty mills one can construct to cut burls, ovals, natural knees (for boatbuilding), how to handle big wood, how to cut circles, trim edges, cut angles, etc. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a597efebd62008f8a6e110bfc42794dcc09e44","amp;dn":"Chainsaw+Lumbering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a597efebd62008f8a6e110bfc42794dcc09e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,165,151,239,235,214,32,8,248,166,225,16,191,196,39,148,220,192,158,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
