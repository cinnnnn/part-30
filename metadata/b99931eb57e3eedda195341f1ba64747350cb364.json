This book provides practical advice that can substantially reduce human error at all levels. In eight chapters--packed with case studies and examples of simple and advanced techniques for new and existing systems--the book challenges the assumption that human error is &quot;unavoidable.&quot; Instead, it suggests a systems perspective. This view sees error as a consequence of a mismatch between human capabilities and demands and inappropriate organizational culture. This makes error a manageable factor and, therefore, avoidable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99931eb57e3eedda195341f1ba64747350cb364","amp;dn":"Guidelines+for+Preventing+Human+Error+in+Process+Safety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99931eb57e3eedda195341f1ba64747350cb364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,153,49,235,87,227,238,221,161,149,52,31,27,166,71,71,53,12,179,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
