The Godfathers deliver muscular and meaty rock &amp; roll with the energy of the Ramones and the Stooges, and a nod toward '60s melodicism. \nThe title track kicks things off with a standard-issue condition of the world lyric over a propulsive guitar-driven sonic bed. Lead singer Peter Coyne is a powerhouse vocalist and the chorus is snappy and infectious. \nThe rest of the album, which gets stronger as it progresses, ranges from the sweet, unabashed guitar pop of &quot;Believe in Yourself&quot; and &quot;Drag Me Down Again&quot; to the metallic stomp of the equally hooky &quot;Something Good About You&quot; and &quot;Can't Try Harder.&quot; \nUnreal World is a thunderous slab of rock played with passion and sincerity.
