Within a very short period of time and at a terrifying pace, workaholic mastermind Jerome Reuter has carved his own path and created and established a dominion of his own, with its own codes and values. Through its bitter sweet melodies of exquisite sadness and rebellion, its haunting lyrics, mesmerizing vocals and recordings of unmatched production and sound, ROME has become the new face of dark romanticism. JeromeÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“??s voice echoes pride and death of a time and place long forgotten. A voice which becomes the axis that breaks oneÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“??s consciousness into some kind of tender submission. Let yourself be buried in the shade of this masterpiece, in the beauty of desperation!\nCome out under the stars! ROME is the light! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ffea35aabaf4bd6aaeecd74e1db3faa4c2f89a7","amp;dn":"Rome+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ffea35aabaf4bd6aaeecd74e1db3faa4c2f89a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,254,163,90,171,175,75,214,170,238,205,116,225,219,63,170,76,47,137,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
