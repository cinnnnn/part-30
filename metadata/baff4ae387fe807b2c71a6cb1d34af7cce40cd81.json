The smooth filter, powerful distortion, and audio modulation combine to take tracks from subtle filtering to all out mayhem.\n\n   Create amazing textures from subtle to devastating\n   Add dynamic motion to static sounds\n   Incredible buildup and breakdown effect\n\n\nADVANCED RESONANCE\n\nDRIVER is an inspiring creative tool from the creator of MASSIVE featuring the rare pairing of a high-quality filter with a punishing distortion unit. The smooth filter section delivers a wide range of effects, from ultra-subtle to incredibly rich, while two modulation sources produce dramatic textural shifts.\n\nThe distortion section is capable of everything from light saturation to complete sonic destruction. Running as a stand-alone effect in any DAW, or as an effect in MASCHINE, DRIVER is perfect for any track needing fresh musical color, total annihilation, or a smooth sweep from one to the other.\n\n\nJAM THE FREQUENCY\n\nBehind DRIVERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intuitive user interface is a powerful set of highly tweakable features. The resonant filter offers both low pass and notch settings. Discover a world of wild new textures by modulating the filter with the envelope follower or audio modulation sections.\n\nFine-tune the envelope follower with the Smooth and Release controls for precise control of the filterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsiveness, or trigger DRIVER via an incoming signal to give any track a shot of dynamic motion.\n\n\nSONIC FURY\n\nDRIVERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distortion section is a sonic beast ready to scratch, abuse, and tear your tracks to shreds. Increase resonance and distortion levels to travel from light, crunchy overtones to thick fuzzed-out bliss Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the sound reacts dynamically in response to the audio input.\n\nWhen using the AM section in Audio Mode, the Clip Cut control allows you to take your tracks deep into a dungeon of audio devastation.\n\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM\n\nFor use with Any DAW as a stand-alone plug-in, VST, RTAS\n\nAAX plugs are cracked, you need cracked AAX Host\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mount the bin file with PowerISO\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install\n\n\n         Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
