RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action/Simulation\n\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  \n\nÃ‚Â  TAKEDOWN is a thinking-person's shooter. The player that takes things slow,\nÃ‚Â  aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who\nÃ‚Â  runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside,\nÃ‚Â  as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of\nÃ‚Â  dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes\nÃ‚Â  and tactics and add replayability.\n\nÃ‚Â  In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide\nÃ‚Â  range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to\nÃ‚Â  slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most\nÃ‚Â  shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health,\nÃ‚Â  linear levels, and &quot;cinematic experiences&quot;. The realistic tactical shooters\nÃ‚Â  with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.\n\nÃ‚Â  This game focuses on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a\nÃ‚Â  close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take\nÃ‚Â  things slow, study your environment, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot\nÃ‚Â  there are consequences. You won't be hiding behind a wall waiting for your\nÃ‚Â  health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess\nÃ‚Â  the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the\nÃ‚Â  mission.\n\nÃ‚Â  Don't expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you - it is up\nÃ‚Â  to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at\nÃ‚Â  hand. With features such as realistic bullet penetration, accuracy, and\nÃ‚Â  recoil, choosing the proper weapons, ammunition, armor, and gear for\nÃ‚Â  the mission is up to you, so choose carefully.\n\nÃ‚Â  Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer.\nÃ‚Â  If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than\nÃ‚Â  running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something\nÃ‚Â  different in your shooter games experience, this is the game for you.\n\nÃ‚Â  FEATURES\nÃ‚Â  ~~~~~~~~\nÃ‚Â  - Fight Smart in Deadly, Close Quarters Combat - Players must think\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  and move tactically, stay alert, watch, listen and choose wisely while\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  setting up their squad for the perfect shot.\n\nÃ‚Â  - Tackle Engagements That Are Different Every Time - Nonlinear maps allow\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  for multiple tactics and approaches to both attack and defense. Gamers\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  must choose their gear to best execute strategy.\n\nÃ‚Â  - Out Think The Enemy - Gamers need to work closely and communicate well\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  with their team to not only attack the enemy but to coordinate to\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â  secure multiple objectives.\n\nÃ‚Â  Ã‚Â \nÃ‚Â  1.
