He travels around Joseon and studies physiognomy. He is able to asses a person's personality, mental state, habits and, consequently, their future, by just studying their face. He lives in seclusion with his son Jin-Hyeong (Lee Jong-Suk) and brother-in-law Paeng-Hun (Cho Jung-Seok). Nae-Kyung hopes to one day become a public officer, even though it is virtually impossible due to his family's failed background.\nOne afternoon, an attractive Gisaeng named Yeon-Hong (Kim Hye-Soo) visits Nae-Kyung's home. She runs a food and alcohol establishment in Hanyang (old name for Seoul). Yeon-Hong asks Nae-Kyung to go with her tthere, because he can make a lot of money.

Kim Jong-Seo (Baek Yoon-Sik), the second most powerful man in the country, hears of Nae-Kyung's abilities and orders him to the palace.
