It is commonly known as The White Album as it has no graphics or text other than the band's name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first The Beatles undertook following the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, and the first released by their own record label, Apple. Originally titled A Doll's House, the title was changed when the British progressive rock band Family released the similarly titled Music in a Doll's House earlier that year.\n\nThe Beatles was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for the group. After visiting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India and having a particularly productive songwriting session in early 1968, the group returned to the studio for recording from May to October 1968, only to have conflict and dissent drive the group members apart. Drummer Ringo Starr quit the band for a brief time, leaving Paul McCartney to perform drums on some of the album's songs.\nUpon release in November 1968, the album received mixed to positive reviews and reached the number one spot on the charts in the United Kingdom and United States. The album is notable for the eclectic nature of its songs, which has divided critics in evaluating the album's legacy. In 2003, the album was ranked number 10 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6136ff28f35608114744642f54afcd96d5d83095","amp;dn":"10%2F14+The+Beatles+%28The+White+Album%29+%5B2009+Stereo+Remaster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6136ff28f35608114744642f54afcd96d5d83095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,54,255,40,243,86,8,17,71,68,100,47,84,175,205,150,213,216,48,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
