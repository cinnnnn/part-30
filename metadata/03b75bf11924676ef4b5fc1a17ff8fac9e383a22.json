Additionally there is a composite video created from several of the opening montages, backed with a custom edited theme song created from the opening and closing themes from two seasons.\n\nI have included some sheet music, lyrics,  and a Sibelius file of the theme.\n\nNote: there are NO FULL episodes included here. This is mainly music from the show and a music video.\t\n\nNOTE - the USA pilots are available via torrent. If you can't find them, I may repack/reseed them later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b75bf11924676ef4b5fc1a17ff8fac9e383a22","amp;dn":"Red+Dwarf+Music+Pak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b75bf11924676ef4b5fc1a17ff8fac9e383a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,183,91,241,25,36,103,110,244,181,252,26,23,255,143,172,158,56,58,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
