This quintet album (which also features trumpeter Dizzy Reece and the young tenor Stanley Turrentine) gave Jordan an opportunity to record six of his originals and, although none became as well-known as his &quot;Jordu,&quot; the music has plenty of strong melodies and variety. This is one of Duke Jordan's better recordings and is quite enjoyable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f9861abef742c901aac93cfd41ad9823d65889","amp;dn":"Duke+Jordan+-+Flight+to+Jordan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f9861abef742c901aac93cfd41ad9823d65889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,249,134,26,190,247,66,201,1,170,201,60,253,65,173,152,35,214,88,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
