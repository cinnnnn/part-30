The New York Times calls it &quot;a vital part of the television landscape...unvarnished realism.&quot; Time declares that The Wire, &quot;like its underfunded, workaday cops, just plugged away until it outshone everything else on TV.&quot;\n\nThe Wire stands not only as riveting drama but also as a sociopolitical treatise with ambitions beyond any television serial. The failure of the drug war, the betrayal of the working class, the \nbureaucratization of the culture and the cost to individual dignity -- such are the themes of the drama's first two seasons. And with every new episode of season three and beyond, another layer of modern urban life will be revealed. Gritty, densely layered, and realistic, The Wire is series television at its very best, told from the point of view of the Baltimore police, their targets, and many of those caught in the middle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6eec9c8f5e9553f4e052909ccb30056b27067d","amp;dn":"The+Wire+-+Truth+Be+Told","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6eec9c8f5e9553f4e052909ccb30056b27067d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,110,236,156,143,94,149,83,244,224,82,144,156,203,48,5,107,39,6,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
