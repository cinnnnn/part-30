On one end, there is wild riffage\nfit for jungle expeditions, skin-tight leather, and stadium seating. And then\nthere is the dive bar sort. ItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a grittier experience and usually involves\nswashbuckling over the cheapest beer in the house, intimate howling from the\nleading man, and a parade of crunchy (but still just as wild) shredding. Both\nvarieties provoke images of steamy men and sexy mic poses. When The Gay Blades\nstart off their full-length Ghosts with Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“O Shot,Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a sassy and abrasive\nguitar-centered piece, my latter version of c-rock is already starting up for a\nretro surf rock-like whiplash. IÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking itÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be a night for the\nages ... if I can remember the next morning.\n\nAnd then Ghosts takes it to a whole new level, a level TGB like to call Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“trash\npop.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Apparently, Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“trash pop is what happens two keenly observant wannabe\nhipsters write songs the same pair couldnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t possibly pull off live and make up\nfor their missing bass player with consistent TNT like performances and a\nheaping spoonful of swagger.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ There is more swagger and attitude on Ghosts than\nmost bands could handle, and this is what sets TGB apart from any other similar\neffort. Some songs bring on a bluesy ballad (Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Prologue For The Pure Of HeartÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½),\nsome songs take on poppier rock with capturing melodies (Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“N.H.D.N.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and some\ncould even fill out the score of RENT (Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dog Day AfternoonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). TGBÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-your-face\nrock is always cool, always impressively arranged, and always entertaining.\n\nFor only two dudes, Clark Westfield and Puppy Mills output a HUGE product. With\ntransitions, textures and elements to spare, these are not simple rock songs,\neven though they do simply rock. A song on Ghosts can hang a left turn at any\nmoment, and none of these jumps are unfortunate. As spazzy as the album is on a\nwhole, I am never lost in the mix. I think this has to do with\nguitarist/vocalist Westfield. He gives off an eager and emotional energy that\nmatches the mood of the moment. Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Robots Fuck Your Shit UpÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins\nself-reflecting and worried. Background vocals kick in with some kosher bah bahs\ntowards the end, and Westfield reacts with a more confident croon-yell\nsyndicate. When the guitars are anxious, so is Westfield. When the song is\nsilly, so is Westfield. When the vibes are flirtatious, Westfield is unbuttoning\nhis shirt. And when Westfield wants a sing-along on Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Why CanÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I Grow A Beard,Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nhe fucking gets one. Ghosts is a hotbed of complexities, and this is from a band\nthat doesnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even have a real bass player.\n\nA common problem I have with gritty pop bands: their work is either\nover-produced, leaving out the good smut, or under-produced and the sound\nequivalent to muddy water. Ghosts is a fit arrangement of both slick and raw\ntones. The final straw of satisfaction comes with sharp song titles like my\npersonal favorite, Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“YouÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re A Garbage Barge, IÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m A Dream Boat.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ There is an\nunderlying (and sometimes obvious) absurdity/quirkiness on Ghosts that is part\nridiculous and part brilliance. Besides being indie rock that actually rocks,\nThe Gay Blades keep it fun. And thatÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something you can take beyond the dive\nbar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b85a7f35e7af00913ebafc00aa1c5819a0e57ede","amp;dn":"The+Gay+Blades-Ghosts-%28Reissue%29-2008-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b85a7f35e7af00913ebafc00aa1c5819a0e57ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,90,127,53,231,175,0,145,62,186,252,0,170,28,88,25,160,229,126,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
