You'll learn how new and more aggressive security measures work -- and where they will lead us. This far-reaching discussion takes you into the techniques, technology, ethics, and laws at the center of the biggest revolution in the history of network security.\nFull Description\n\nWith the ever-increasing risks and rewards in today's networked world, new and more aggressive forms of defending networks have evolved. No longer content to take and assess damage after an attack, companies are looking at measured responses to protect their networks while under attack. Regardless of what you call it, whether it's aggressive self-defense or vigilantism, these techniques and technology are at the center of the biggest revolution in the history of network security. This book shows you why they are not only feasible but inevitable.\n\n\nIn Self-Defending Networks, the luminaries and pioneers of network security take you beyond the headlines, hype, and hearsay to provide insight into why new measures are being undertaken and how they work. Some of them discuss how these new techniques have evolved and where they will lead us; others explore how the techniques bring into question the very beliefs, ethics, laws, and morals that have guided information security so far. This topic is generating intense interest in the security community, and the contributors to &quot;Self-Defending Networks&quot; offer a balanced assessment that covers both sides of the issue. It's a far-reaching discussion you can't afford to miss.\nTable of Contents\n\n   1.\n      Chapter 1 Psychological Security Traps\n         1.\n            Learned Helplessness and
