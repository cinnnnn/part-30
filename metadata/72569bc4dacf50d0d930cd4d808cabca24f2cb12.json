Upon meeting, the two quickly discovered they had similar taste in music and in their aspirations. \nKerry soon introduced guitarist Jeff Hanneman and recruited Chilean-born bassist and vocalist Tom Araya, who had played with King before in the band Quits (previously known as Tradewinds). \nThe band played cover versions of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs at clubs and parties in Southern California. \nEarly shows relied on a Satanic image, which featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses. \nRumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 movie of the same name, were denied by King, as he stated: &quot;We never were; it's a myth to this day.&quot;\n\n  \t\t01 - Cast The First Stone.mp3 \t8.63 MB\n  \t\t02 - Repentless.mp3 \t3.14 MB\n  \t\t03 - When the Stillness Comes.mp3 \t9.93 MB\n  \t\t04   Implode.mp3 \t9.03 MB\nDescription     05   You Against You.mp3 \t6.67 MB\n\n\n\nDont think any more singles are coming unless they want to piece it out.\nBut you never know its Metal and anything can happen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72569bc4dacf50d0d930cd4d808cabca24f2cb12","amp;dn":"Slayer++-++No+Warning+%28EP%29+2015+vbr+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72569bc4dacf50d0d930cd4d808cabca24f2cb12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,86,155,196,218,207,80,208,217,48,205,77,128,140,171,202,36,242,203,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
