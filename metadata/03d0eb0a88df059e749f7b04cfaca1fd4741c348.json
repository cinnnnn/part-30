This series chronicles the shocking accidents which left the most bizarre foreign objects ever to find themselves in the human body. Talking to the victims, those that were there at the scene and using CGI and x-rays this series recounts some of the most inexplicable, unexpected and simply astounding stories in modern medicine. Using testimony and reconstruction the series focuses on how these dangerous and bizarre objects found themselves in the body and why they were often inches away from being fatal.\nLethal Pursuit \nTo dare is to do: sporting heroes and heroines whose encounters with body invaders lead to near fatal experiences.

A young man goes for a relaxing after work surf in Auckland, New Zealand and ends up with thirty centimetres of fibre glass surf board embedded in his skull. Will doctors be able to save his life, or even his looks?
