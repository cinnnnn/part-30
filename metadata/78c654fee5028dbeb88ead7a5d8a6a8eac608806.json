He develops both physical and mental problems, and thinks it must only be him until he finds ten mates, all who remain of his platoon who fought and died, are affected the same way. Now they are eleven angry men out for revenge. They rope in an ex-Viet Cong with &amp;#039;special skills&amp;#039; and his own secret agenda. They&amp;#039;re the real life &amp;#039;Dirty Dozen&amp;#039;, only they&amp;#039;re so screwed up they couldn&amp;#039;t fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Until a woman of character steps in. Wendy&amp;#039;s infant daughter is dying and needs a bone marrow transplant. She sets out to mould this bunch of ex-jungle fighters into a unit that will fight for justice, by fair means or foul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c654fee5028dbeb88ead7a5d8a6a8eac608806","amp;dn":"Bryce+Courtenay+-+Smoky+Joe%5C%27s+Cafe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c654fee5028dbeb88ead7a5d8a6a8eac608806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,198,84,254,229,2,141,190,184,142,173,122,93,138,106,142,172,96,136,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
