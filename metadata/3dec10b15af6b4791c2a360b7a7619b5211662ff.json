Dorf (CRC, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nIn two editions spanning more than a decade, The Electrical Engineering Handbook stands as the definitive reference to the multidisciplinary field of electrical engineering. Our knowledge continues to grow, and so does the Handbook. For the third edition, it has expanded into a set of six books carefully focused on a specialized area or field of study. Each book represents a concise yet definitive collection of key concepts, models, and equations in its respective domain, thoughtfully gathered for convenient access.\r\nSensors, Nanoscience, Biomedical Engineering, and Instruments provides thorough coverage of sensors, materials and nanoscience, instruments and measurements, and biomedical systems and devices, including all of the basic information required to thoroughly understand each area. It explores the emerging fields of sensors, nanotechnologies, and biological effects. Each article includes defining terms, references, and sources of further information.\r\n\r\nEncompassing the work of the worldâ€™s foremost experts in their respective specialties, Sensors, Nanoscience, Biomedical Engineering, and Instruments features the latest developments, the broadest scope of coverage, and new material on multisensor data fusion and MEMS and NEMS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dec10b15af6b4791c2a360b7a7619b5211662ff","amp;dn":"Sensors%2C+Nanoscience%2C+Biomedical+Engineering+and+Instruments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dec10b15af6b4791c2a360b7a7619b5211662ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,236,16,177,90,246,180,121,28,42,54,11,122,118,25,181,33,22,98,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
