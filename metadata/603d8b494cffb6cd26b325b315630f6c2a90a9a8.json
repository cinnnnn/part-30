This is my first PDF so the compression is terrible and the quality isn&amp;#039;t sparkling, but here it  is.\n\nDescription:\n&quot;The legends were true. King Arthur&amp;#039;s Camelot was every bit as wondrous as the tales it inspired... and its fall every bit as bleak. After Arthur&amp;#039;s death, his sister Morgen, Queen of the fey, took Camelot for her own. By her side stands a new dark Pendragon known only as the Kerrigan. with his help, Morgen rules over all the dark lands. In opposition to them is Merlin and the remnants of Arthur&amp;#039;s Knights, no known as the Lords of Avalon. Rumors foretell the coming of the next Merlin, and both sides race to find its origins, leading them to the most unlikely of place: a simple peasant girl.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603d8b494cffb6cd26b325b315630f6c2a90a9a8","amp;dn":"LordsofAvalon+-+Sword+of+Darkness+-+Issue+1+Varient+cover+-+Low-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603d8b494cffb6cd26b325b315630f6c2a90a9a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,61,139,73,76,255,182,205,38,179,37,179,21,99,15,108,42,144,169,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
