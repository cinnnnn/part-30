It also includes Tetragrammaton, an outline of the Keys of the Mysteries based on the insight of Pythagoras that the Numbers of Mathematics are the most abstract and original symbols of the Mysteries of Nature, illuminating the meaning of the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah and the Tetragrammaton, the four letter Name of God, the meaning of which has been assumed to have been lost.\n\nThe present release features a scanned copy of Theophany, originally published in 1979:\n\nTheophany, by John Stahl, 1979, San Francisco, 134 copies; 24 pages, hand set letterpress, hand bound over cords in hard covers, hand made paper, four full color illustrations; leather covers, gold tooled, gilt edges. This ambitious project follows the Lapis Philosophorum as the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt to express the primary abstract patterns which underlie the functioning of the cosmos. It incorporates a lot of new material: relating the abstract patterns of metaphysics to the Tetragrammaton and the Tree of Life from the Kabbalah, and relating the planets and metals of astrology and alchemy to the trigrams of the I Ching. \nISBN: 0-945303-05-X . . . $450.00 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f3c5a3b70898032857ae3ffcfd841fba402b72","amp;dn":"Theophany%2C+The+Laughter+of+God%2C+and+Tetragrammaton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f3c5a3b70898032857ae3ffcfd841fba402b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,243,197,163,183,8,152,3,40,87,174,63,252,253,132,31,186,64,43,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
