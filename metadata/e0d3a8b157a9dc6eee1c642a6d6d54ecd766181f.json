Capable of creating exact bit-level copies of USB Flash Drive (UFDs), ImageUSB is an extremely effective tool for the mass duplication of UFDs.\n\nUnlike other USB duplication tools, ImageUSB can preserve all unused and slack space during the cloning process, including the Master Boot Record (MBR). ImageUSB can perform flawless mass duplications of all UFD images, including bootable UFDs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d3a8b157a9dc6eee1c642a6d6d54ecd766181f","amp;dn":"ImageUSB+1.1+Build+1010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d3a8b157a9dc6eee1c642a6d6d54ecd766181f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,211,168,177,87,169,220,110,238,28,100,42,109,109,84,236,215,102,24,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
