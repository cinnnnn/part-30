All of these songs mean something special to me. That said, I'm not typically a fan of tribute albums mostly because those who perform them are usually some garage band that nobody has ever or will ever hear of beyond the tribute plus they just ruin the songs you love. This one, however, is different.\n\nI saw Jizzy Pearl (Love/Hate, Ratt, L.A. Guns) was on the album. When I saw his name as well as Phil Lewis (L.A. Guns, Girl) and Jani Lane (Warrant), I knew I had to check it out. I'm glad I did. It reeks of awesomeness!\n\nI like Jani's version of Photograph better than the original! Phil Lewis did justice to Bringin' on the Heartache, and Jizzy... Jizzy can take any song and make it grand in my opinion. Great version of High 'n' Dry.\n\nJohn Corabi (Ratt, Motley Crue, Union) did a good job with Wasted. Jason McMaster (Dangerous Toys) did a fantastic job with Let it Go. I was truly shocked by how good that version was. Again, it topped the original in my opinion. Theer is no bad song on the CD!\n\nThe closest thing to a &quot;let down&quot; was Rock Rock by Kevin DuBrow (Quiet Riot.) Kevin belts it out, but they techno'd that song up. It sounds like something you'd hear at a club with a metal singer belting it out rather than computerized vocals. I still like it because Kevin sounds strong and into it, but if the song's called Rock Rock, it should... Rock Rock, not Techno Techno.\n\nUltimately, this is a rock tribute to Def Leppard. Many of the participants of this tribute album went in and did a rock tribute to Guns 'n' Roses more recently. So, you're not going to get the more &quot;pop&quot; Def Leppard that some fans want. You're going to get the rocking Def Leppard, the only Def Leppard I acknowledge. Basically, if you're a fan of true metal or just love Def Leppard, give this album a spin. It's a great tribute!
