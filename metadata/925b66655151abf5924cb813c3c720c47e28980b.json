This volume examines the ancient near eastern civilizations as a backdrop to a discussion of the historical locus of order in Israel. The drama of Israel mirrors the problems associated with the tension of existence as Israel attempted to reconcile the claims of transcendent order with those of pragmatic existence and so becomes paradigmatic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925b66655151abf5924cb813c3c720c47e28980b","amp;dn":"Order+and+History+%28Volume+1%29%3A+Israel+and+Revelation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925b66655151abf5924cb813c3c720c47e28980b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,91,102,101,81,81,171,245,146,76,184,19,195,199,32,196,126,40,152,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
