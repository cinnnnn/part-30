They release new album Ã¢â‚¬ËœColoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ via Tin Angel Records on 23th September. Following on from her acclaimed talent for moulding elements of jazz and folk with an indie-pop and country pastiche, comes a self-effacing and quirky collaboration bringing with it a new found confidence that has allowed Sproule and OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill to stretch into a new musical ground. \nOpening with the colourful summer tune Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou Can Come HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the listener is immersed into the world of Devon Sproule picking up from where 2011 album Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Love You Go EasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ left off. The go- easy rhythm section builds up to crashing percussion that cascades and collides with the striking bass lines of musical maestro Dan Fortin. Leading into the hazily paced Ã¢â‚¬ËœMagic In The PanicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ their first vocal duet seeing OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢NeillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indelible voice echoing into the aether. \nWearing their hearts firmly on their sleeves comes the illuminating title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœColoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which is a quintessential lo-fi pop song humming with animated and whirling electronics. The captivating Ã¢â‚¬ËœWalking In The FollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reaches beautiful high notes with the sweeping trombone of frequent collaborator Doug Tielli while Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalk To YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ encompasses the spirit of the Beatles. \nThe duo first met when O'Neill submitted a song to Low-Key Karaoke, a project in which Sproule splices videos of herself and others singing together to create remote duets. At first too shy to video himself, Sproule encouraged O'Neill to submit more and before long, they were writing songs together; he from Halifax, Nova Scotia and she currently located in Austin, Texas. \nÃ¢â‚¬ËœColoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features an all-star Toronto band including guitar and synth wiz Thom Gill, a rhythm section borrowed from the R&amp;B project Bernice (Robin Dann on vocals, Philip Melanson on Drums and Dan Fotin on bass) and Sandro Perri at the production helm. Considering how long these two Ontarians have been away from home; Colours is decidedly a product of Toronto. The city, the songs and the ensemble have knocked these two established artists off balance and right into their element. \nThere is a striking resemblance between Devon and Mike, though one might have to look a little closer to find it in their music. O'Neill's early work as singer/bassist/songwriter for the Inbreds paved the way for a solo career of complex, melody-driven pop. After an eight year hiatus, 2012 saw him release his follow-up solo album Ã¢â‚¬ËœWild LinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \nOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neill's credentials include winning the Gemini award for his compositions on food program Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrench Food At HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and is known for his portrayal of Thomas Collins in TV show Trailer Park Boys. \nAmerican chanteuse Devon Sproule has four critically acclaimed albums under her Tin Angel belt including Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Love You Go EasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœKeep Your Silver ShinedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Performances include Glastonbury, Cambridge Folk Festival, Moseley Folk Festival along with sell-out performances from Union Chapel and the QEH. Tour supports include a plethora of legendary artists such as Richie Havens, Lucinda Williams and Bill Callahan. Back in her teen years it was the attention of Dave Matthews eye that saw her on the road with the Dave Matthews Band and en route to a steady career in music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc92d899f8febce45ef33d839e3fef476dc7c236","amp;dn":"Devon+Sproule+%26amp%3B+Mike+O%27Neill+-+Colours+%5B2013%5D%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc92d899f8febce45ef33d839e3fef476dc7c236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,146,216,153,248,254,188,228,94,243,61,131,158,63,239,71,109,199,194,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
