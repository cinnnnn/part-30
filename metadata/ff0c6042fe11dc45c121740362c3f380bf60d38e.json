The reedman isn't blowing as\nbelligerently as usual, tempted into exposing his softer side, his warm tone\ndenuded of its lime-scale textures.\n\nThe material is clearly composed, but in such a manner that much of the trio's\ninteraction sounds completely improvised (there are pieces penned by each\nmember). The language of the spontaneous is becoming so advanced (or even\ningrained) that it's becoming increasingly difficult to discern the moment when\none form flows into the other. The disc's opening skirmish reveals all three\nplayers in a swiftly overlapping state and then Humair takes a drum solo,\nfollowed by more trio flooding and then, in the name of symmetry, a piano\nsolo. Humair's skins are tonally rich down at the low end, helping fill in any\nabsence felt (imagined or not) by the absence of a bassist.\n\nAll three are constantly restless and enquiring, continually seeking\nsatisfaction, with themes and solos smudging into each other in a blur of\nhyperactivity. On the title track, K ÃƒÂ¼hn takes off on a crazed scamper, with\nMalaby entering at what turns out to be the piece's peak, acting as a closing\nforce. Then &quot;Ghisl ÃƒÂ¨ne&quot; is a staccato head-banger, with complete equality for\nall three players, as they intuitively negotiate outbursts of either dominance\nor passivity, switching roles in an instant, energized, but also moving through\na varied range of dynamic stages.\n\n--\n\nby Stef\n\nper Michel Contat (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telerama.fr/musiques/full-contact,30301.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telerama.fr/musiques/full-contact,30301.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff0c6042fe11dc45c121740362c3f380bf60d38e","amp;dn":"Daniel+Humair%2C+Joachim+K%26uuml%3Bhn%2C+Tony+Malaby+-+Full+Contact+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff0c6042fe11dc45c121740362c3f380bf60d38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,12,96,66,254,17,220,69,193,33,116,3,98,195,243,128,191,96,211,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
