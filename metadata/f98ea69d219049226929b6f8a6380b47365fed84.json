After FOB's indie debut hit the underground charts, the group's sudden indie-style success made for a fast growth spurt. Their appeal is obvious, from frontman Patrick Stump's Killer-esque pipes (especially evidenced in the disc-closer, &quot;XO&quot;) to their very melodic teen angst-anthems. While much of the disc operates at usual punk-pop speed, the highlight comes from a slower, emotion-laden cut called &quot;I've Got A Dark Alley And A Bad Idea That Says You Should Shut Your Mouth.&quot; This song of living in the public while working through private pain is a beautiful, multi-layered number that stays with long after the album is over. --Denise Sheppard \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like Fall Out Boy, check out these other artists:\n\nMatchbook Romance \nSenses Fail \nThe Starting Line \nEarly November \nBrand New \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98ea69d219049226929b6f8a6380b47365fed84","amp;dn":"Fall+Out+Boy+-+From+Under+the+Cork+Tree%28adonis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98ea69d219049226929b6f8a6380b47365fed84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,142,166,157,33,144,73,34,105,41,182,248,166,56,11,71,54,95,237,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
