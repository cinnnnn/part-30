Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble (Willem Dafoe), a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen (Jared Leto), whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. American Psycho also features Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's girlfriend, as well as Samantha Mathis, Chloe Sevigny, and Guinevere Turner; the latter also co-authored the screenplay. Controversy followed the production from the start, when speculation that Leonardo Di Caprio would play Bateman sparked concerns that he would lure preteens to an R-rated movie. Di Caprio soon bowed out of the project, and original leading man Bale was reinstated. Later, a group of Toronto residents attempted to block filming in that city after Canadian serial killer Paul Bernardo claimed that Ellis's novel inspired his murder spree.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/a1O2hAO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/a1O2hAO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/b3E9Glq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/b3E9Glq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/57aTxBF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/57aTxBF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/gnSz0Kh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/gnSz0Kh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/zX7zOMs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/zX7zOMs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Wc6X6AW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Wc6X6AW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/DMczJdj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/DMczJdj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/6EOdRwD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/6EOdRwD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/I6K7UHx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/I6K7UHx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/ibbkt9irb14cs6nj62yx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/ibbkt9irb14cs6nj62yx.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMEDIA-INFO\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$7.000.000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:Ã‚Â£749.526 (UK) (21 April 2000)\nGross:ESP 466.785.361 (Spain) (29 June 2001) \n\n\n\n\nTrivia\nThe Huey Lewis and the News song &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot;, which appears in the film, was initially on the soundtrack album, but it was removed shortly after release because of a lack of publishing rights. The album was recalled and reissued without the song, although some versions of the initial batch had already sold. Over the years, this incident has developed into the myth that Huey Lewis himself refused to allow the song on the album due to the content of the movie. \n\nGoofs\nPatrick pronounces &quot;Robert Palmer&quot; as &quot;Robert Parmer&quot;, revealing a flaw in Christian Bale's staged American accent. \n\nQuotes\nPatrick Bateman: You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood.\n\n\n\n\n*Title.....................:  The Amazing Spider-Man\n*Genre.....................:  Crime | Drama\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 2012/English\n*Source....................: Blu-ray Remux \n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass \n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 2.89 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 4 050 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 3 600 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 448 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 800 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/2.40:1\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 42mn/01min \n*SUBTiTLES IDX:.................: English,Portuguese,Greek,French,\nIndonesian,Danish,Bulgarian,Finnish,Romanian.\n              \n\n            Menu \n\n00:00:00.000 : Main Titles/ Dinner and Dancing \n00:04:42.067 : My Name Is Patrick Bateman \n00:09:06.234 : Traditional Moral Values \n00:15:14.668 : Calling Cards \n00:20:07.235 : Mask of Sanity \n00:24:47.268 : Hip to Be Square \n00:31:16.169 : Detective Kimball \n00:37:03.503 : Making Plans \n00:40:04.070 : In Too Deep \n00:45:23.771 : Card Envy \n00:49:36.538 : Returning Videotapes \n00:51:53.406 : Can We Talk? \n00:55:18.906 : Murders &amp; Executions \n00:59:26.039 : So Many Possibilities \n01:04:55.673 : Discussing Alibis \n01:09:10.007 : Totally Disease Free \n01:12:21.274 : Greatest Love of All \n01:15:30.041 : Erratic Behavior \n01:18:28.942 : Shooting Spree \n01:21:48.009 : A Pretty Sick Guy \n01:24:55.710 : Paul's Apartment \n01:30:10.110 : Simply Not Possible \n01:34:16.011 : No Catharsis \n01:36:59.178 : End Credits\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/xa3caopjye64m6sfuvz8.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/xa3caopjye64m6sfuvz8.gif&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c823e85f5b5a68e43ae40c3a0ba8e256915eda92","amp;dn":"American+Psycho+%282000%29+1080p+BDRip+AAC+x264-tomcat12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c823e85f5b5a68e43ae40c3a0ba8e256915eda92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,35,232,95,91,90,104,228,58,228,12,58,11,168,226,86,145,94,218,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
