Safely reveal map for those who only want this function.\nThis feature doesen't make any change to game code and will do an integrity scan before revealing map for safe.\n\nFor those who really care about detection, here's smoe advice:\n1. D2loader maybe not safe and can be detected by blizzard so better not to use it. Integrity scaner will show you where exactly it does to game.\n2. Maphack 5.1 edited (and all derived) version is detectable, at least by 65 packet to my knowledge.\n\nSIMPLE USE INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Extract all files from D2HACKMAP.ZIP to any folder.\n2. Run d2hackmap.exe.\n3. Run Diablo II.\n4. Alt+tab out of Diablo II. Better do this step after connected to Battle.net if you are going to play on battle.net, otherwise d2hackmap will unload himself when connecting to battle.net.\n5. Click &quot;Install/update&quot; to inject d2hackmap.dll into Diablo II process if you want to enjoy full functions. Or click &quot;Reveal Act&quot; to reveal automap of current act when you are in game, it's less function but more safe. You can also customize d2hackmap.exe's behaviour by editing d2hackmap.ini.\n6. Alt+tab back to Diablo II and play.\n\n\n-Shootnone-\n\nBringing What The People Need! =]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7189dd310c711cf876c76946fc651299fb33ee","amp;dn":"Diablo+2+-+Stings+Maphack+1.13c-Shootnone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7189dd310c711cf876c76946fc651299fb33ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,113,137,221,49,12,113,28,248,118,199,105,70,252,101,18,153,251,51,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
