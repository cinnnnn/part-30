When they go for it, it?s astonishing?? - Pitchfork\n(SXSW Review by Paul Thompson)\nThe Constantines are the children of Fugazi, stepbrothers to Make-Up and Trail\nof Dead, the grand-kids of Springsteen and Strummer. They call what they do soul\nmusic, not because of what it sounds like, but where it hits you.?- EYE Weekly\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ec683b21eda2b3ad1524b1dad14d97de18b03af","amp;dn":"Constantines-Kensington_Heights-2008-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ec683b21eda2b3ad1524b1dad14d97de18b03af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,198,131,178,30,218,43,58,209,82,75,29,173,20,217,125,225,139,3,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
