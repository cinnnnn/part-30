After multiple battles, Queen Allie just might have the time to start building a relationship with the dragon next door, Winston, before her sixteenth birthday. But unrest is forming at the borders and soon she realizes that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just the Fate Maker who wants to take her crown, but her aunt, Queen Bavasama.\n\nWhen Bavasama sends her troops over the border into Nerissette on a campaign of mass destruction, Allie has to decide whether or not sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to bring her battle-scarred country back to war. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take the chance of letting more people die, or letting those sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost disappear from memory.\n\nShe must survive long enough to save her country and, in the end, decide what she will do when faced with a final, horrible series of choices.\nGenre: Science Fiction, Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8c2cbeb1082f14d6d7a940adf7c3e06ab9c8e4","amp;dn":"Infinity+%28Chronicles+of+Nerissette%29+-+Buchanan%2C+Andria.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8c2cbeb1082f14d6d7a940adf7c3e06ab9c8e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,140,44,190,177,8,47,20,214,215,169,64,173,247,195,224,106,185,200,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
