His interest for music started at early age, \n        in his teenage years he started to develop a huge interest in \n        hardcore music and visited his first rave at the age of 14.\n\n        From that moment on he had the feeling that DJ-ing and producing \n        was the thing he was destined to do. From the moment he had the \n        opportunity to show everyone what TRIAX stood for, he left his \n        mark on the hardcore scene. Each of his productions such as \n        'Assasins' &amp; 'Chronic Beats' became instant classics! And let's \n        not forget his collaborations with artists such as D-Ceptor,\n        Newstyler &amp; Mr. Sinister! \n\n        Besides releases on UHM Triax has also released numerous well \n        received productions on labels such as Meta4, Rage Records, \n        Wishcraft Records &amp; Megarave Records. Because of the high quality \n        of his productions, collaborations and remixes they appeared on\n        numerous compilations worldwide!\n\n        Behind the wheels of steel, as a DJ, Triax shows us his passion \n        he has for hardcore. In his studio and ultimately on his vinyls \n        you hear the passion has for hardcore. His bookings have \n        skyrocketed the past couple of years with national as well as\n        international (France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Swiss, Spain \n        &amp; Germany) gigs. Raving Nightmare, Nightmare Outdoor, Q-Base, \n        Nature One &amp; Megarave are just a few of the parties where Triax \n        has showed the crowd his skills.\n\n        Therefore it's no more than a logical choice that the front man \n        of the UHM label delivers us his first solo album, a new \n        milestone in his career! An album with all his topnotch \n        productions from the past combined with lots of new material \n        and remixes by colleagues. This album is a must have for all \n        the hardcore heads worldwide and an excellent addition to the \n        already stunning Rotterdam Records catalogue!\n\n\n       _________________________[ Tracklist ]____________________________\n\n\n        CD 1/2\n\n        1.
