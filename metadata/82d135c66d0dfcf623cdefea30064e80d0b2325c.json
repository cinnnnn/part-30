In it a man - Josef K. - is arrested\nand prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority.\nThe reason for his arrest and trial are not revealed.\n\nWhat he does discover is that his arresting officers\nare already suffering punishments behind closed doors.\nThe best advice he receives is that, as a guilty verdict\nis inevitable, he should drag the trial out.\n\nHe is tried and found guilty.\n\nThis book is considered so important because it pre-\nfigures the return to 'show trials' to stiffle dissent, and\neliminate at will, through misapplied judicial process. \n\nCast\nJosef K. - Mike Gwilym\nFrau Grubach - Maddie Head\nUncle Karl - Stephen Thorne\nHerr Huld, the Lawyer - Nigel Graham\nLeni, Herr Huld's nurse - Miriam Margolyes\nBank Clerk - Robin Brown\nRudi Block, the Merchant - Michael Bilton\nTitorelli, the Painter - Jim Reid\nWhip wielder - Jim Reid\nWillem - David Peart\nFranz - Stuart Orden\nPriest - Hugh Dixon\nInspector - Simon Hewitt\nNeighbour - Eva Stuart\nWoman in Courtroom - Rosalin Addams\nExamining Magistrate - Edward Caste\nSecretary - Jean Trend\nGirl - Wendy Murray\nEnquiries Department Representative - Ray Jones\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d135c66d0dfcf623cdefea30064e80d0b2325c","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Franz+Kafka%5C%27s+%5C%27The+Trial%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d135c66d0dfcf623cdefea30064e80d0b2325c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,209,53,198,109,13,252,246,35,205,239,234,48,6,78,128,208,178,50,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
