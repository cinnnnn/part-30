Rich\n\nIllustrated by Andi Watson\n\nRob Grafton and Louise Bright are in love and engaged to be married. When they unexpectedly find themselves unemployed, marriage plans are derailed and they are forced to rethink the direction of their lives. While Louise turns to school, Rob maintains a staunch desire to regain his old job, but when the company is itself shut down and hope is lost, Rob's depression not only keeps him from finding another job, but ends up repelling Louise, as well. Set in contemporary England, Breakfast After Noon is a unique comic-book treat, choosing to focus on the twists and turns of real life rather than convoluted plots or the smoke-and-mirrors of the fantastic.\n\nOther books by Andi Watson...\n\nKitsune Tales &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608514/Kitsune_Tales_(Slave_Labor_Graphics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608514/Kitsune_Tales_(Slave_Labor_Graphics)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSkeleton Key - Beyond The Threshold &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608690/Skeleton_Key_%28Slave_Labor_Graphics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608690/Skeleton_Key_%28Slave_Labor_Graphics%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSlow News Day &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608724/Slow_News_Day_%28Slave_Labor_Graphics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7608724/Slow_News_Day_%28Slave_Labor_Graphics%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07655c199943aa3da831069917470ea82ac1cae9","amp;dn":"Breakfast+After+Noon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07655c199943aa3da831069917470ea82ac1cae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,101,92,25,153,67,170,61,168,49,6,153,23,71,14,168,42,193,202,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
