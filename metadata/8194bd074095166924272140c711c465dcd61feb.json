J. Cale - 1992 - Number 10\n\nThere are no major surprises on Cale's tenth outing; fans get the same dependable, unassuming, comfy results, like a well-worn but form-fitting pair of slippers. Subtle licks percolate and resonate from the front-porch jam session on &quot;Jailer&quot; and &quot;Low Rider.&quot; &quot;Lonesome Train&quot; and &quot;Shady Grove&quot; choogle along, as amiable as they are hypnotic. The closest thing to a twist comes with the phased vocals and spiralling guitar runs of &quot;Digital Blues.&quot; It would be easy to imagine Number 10 getting completely buried behind a wash of '90s white noise, but for those prepared to kick off their boots and sit a spell, Cale's latest offers up some seductive rewards.
