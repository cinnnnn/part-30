The band was officially formed in 1986, although some date the band to bedroom tape experiments from 1982.[1][2] The band&amp;#039;s output is usually referred to as noise rock or sometimes Japanoise, though their more recent records have been largely based around repetitive minimalism, ambient music, and tribal drumming.\n\nThe band has a vast and sometimes confusing discography. Many band members have rotated through the group over the years, often using a number of various stage names. Singer Yamantaka Eye is the closest the band has to a frontman; his style includes a range of baffling screams, babbling, electronic effects, and very heavy post-production. Drummer/singer/trumpeter Yoshimi P-We has also featured on most Boredoms recordings.&quot;\n\n-from wiki\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:141b9e0ce8a1510cd60320de7a835b95672d4ba3","amp;dn":"Boredoms+-+Osorezan+No+Stooges+Kyo+88+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"141b9e0ce8a1510cd60320de7a835b95672d4ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,27,158,12,232,161,81,12,214,3,32,222,122,131,91,149,103,45,75,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
