Afterwards, he made one other notable appearance, with the New Warriors in Marvel Comics Presents, and was unseen until a Civil War cameo in She-Hulk. He also regularly appeared in Avengers: The Initiative as a recruit.  Slapstick resembles an animated clown and has the abilities of a slapstick cartoon character, such as one from Looney Tunes, including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.\n\nThanks goes to Toker The Kid for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ccaf00966bf19e3a683a09c36c94ca84f49e7d6","amp;dn":"Slapstick+%231-4+%281992-1993%29+%5BMarvel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ccaf00966bf19e3a683a09c36c94ca84f49e7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,202,240,9,102,191,25,227,166,131,160,156,54,201,76,168,79,73,231,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
