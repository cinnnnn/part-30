Adcock\n\nHailing from Lafayette, Louisiana, Charles Clinton Adcock learned early that their were musicians in his immediate presence of at least as much importance as the rock 'n' roll that he was similarly digging by the Rolling Stones and Elvis Presley. He was soon gigging with Bobby Charles and touring with Bo Diddley, only coming home to form the legendary Cowboy Stew Blues Revue with his friend '60s soul guitarist L'il Buck Sinigal. Issuing a self-titled album in 1994 he followed it with House Rocker in 2000, in between forming the swamp pop super group L'il Band O' Gold with his friend accordionist Steve Riley and their mutual heroes, drummer Warren Storm and saxophonist Dickie Landry.\n\nOriginal Release Date: October 17, 2000\n\n1.
