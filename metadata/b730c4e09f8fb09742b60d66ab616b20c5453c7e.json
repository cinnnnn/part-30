A team of Force Reconnaissance Marines led by Lieutenant Shane Schofield, nicknamed &quot;Scarecrow&quot; because of eye injuries he sustained in Bosnia, is dispatched to secure the station, where they learn the scientists at the base had discovered something made of metal buried within layers of ice hundreds of millions of years old. As Schofield's Marines set about securing the station, they must deal with French paratroopers posing as researchers, traitors within the unit looking to make sure only certain people know of the discovery, a team of British SAS operatives sent to the station, and Sarah Hensleigh, a member of ICG resident within the research team who has already killed one of her co-workers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b730c4e09f8fb09742b60d66ab616b20c5453c7e","amp;dn":"01+-+Ice+Station","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b730c4e09f8fb09742b60d66ab616b20c5453c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,48,196,224,159,143,176,151,66,182,13,102,171,97,107,32,197,69,60,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
