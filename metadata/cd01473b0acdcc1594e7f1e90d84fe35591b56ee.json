Gently immersive and especially effective at low volume, the non-dynamic nature of this space can support sleeping as well as creative states, reading and other functions where &quot;music&quot; is considered invasive. Purposely untitled, minimal in nature and sonically uninterrupted for 74 minutes, this &quot;tone zone&quot; brings Steve&amp;#039;s years as a sound painter of deep subtlety to a point where the &quot;brush&quot; has only a few bristles and nothing more is needed.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSlow Heat (1998), preview -&gt; http://www.steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=8\n\ndescription:\nSLOW HEAT rises and falls, breathes in and exhales a constant flow of calming influence. Shaped over two summers of evaluation on Steve&amp;#039;s patio playback system, the sounds of the warm desert nights were found to be in perfect tune to the sound-world playing back for hours on the speakers outdoors. These sounds were recorded by stretching 50 foot mic cables from the Timeroom out into the desert night, capturing a pure moment of natural magic to be included in the piece. Perhaps no other long-form piece from Steve has placed the listener in such an intimate and subtle expression of the sensual nature of the desert atmosphere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd01473b0acdcc1594e7f1e90d84fe35591b56ee","amp;dn":"Steve+Roach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd01473b0acdcc1594e7f1e90d84fe35591b56ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,1,71,59,10,205,204,21,148,231,241,233,13,132,254,53,89,27,86,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
