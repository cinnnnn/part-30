He wrote novels, critiques, a play, and poetry. His literary works were noted for their Surrealism, elegant style and refined vocabulary. Gracq taught history and geography in various lycÃƒÂ©es. A close friend of AndrÃƒÂ© Breton, his work was inspired by German Romanticism, and combines startling imagery with a rich, precise metre.\n\nStaunchly avoiding the French literary scene-he refused the Prix Goncourt in 1951-he is one of the few authors to have been published in the BibliothÃƒÂ¨que de la PlÃƒÂ©iade during his lifetime.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'Argol or The Castle of Argol - Julien Gracq , Translated from the French by Louise VarÃƒÂ¨se (Pushkin Press) -- ePUB\n\n===================================================================================\n\nAnnotation:\n\nAn isolated castle stands in a wild, desolate landscape, surrounded by dark woods. Its new owner, a rich, dissolute young man, has invited his best friend to stay. When he arrives, he brings with him a radiant, seductive and strangely detached young woman. She, in turn, will bring death and destruction to the ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'Argol.\n\nWith its opulent, atmospheric descriptions of a savage, surreal Breton landscape and its exquisite sense of foreboding, ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'Argol is a work of beauty and terror.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/julien-gracq-distinguished-novelist-known-for-his-surrealism-and-solitude-who-refused-all-literary-honours-766767.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/julien-gracq-distinguished-novelist-known-for-his-surrealism-and-solitude-who-refused-all-literary-honours-766767.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Gracq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Gracq&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b26fde875d4cffef289d32334e90004dbb8325d","amp;dn":"Chateau+d%27Argol+-+Julien+Gracq+%28French+Author%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b26fde875d4cffef289d32334e90004dbb8325d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,38,253,232,117,212,207,254,242,137,211,35,52,233,0,4,219,184,50,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
