If you have the update, you should see &quot;Version 30B&quot; on your screen in white text in the upper right hand corner. You shouldn't need to do anything else.\n\nv30B includes a save/load system!\n\nThese are still a work in progress, and there are a handful of bugs we're trying to fix. If your save fails to load the first time, try again (we're not sure what causes that quite yet); if you get a random save crash, please let us know on the forums and send us a .DMP file.\n\nSecond, we've fixed support on Windows for user names with Unicode characters. Again, this should just work; we've tested it internally and had no issues, but if it doesn't, please let us know.
