ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost an initiation rite if you want kudos for your folk chops, and Melbourne four-piece Husky are no exception, their debut record Forever So the result of a comparable backstory. Based around the songs of singer/guitarist Husky Gawenda and keyboardist Gideon Preiss, the band tread a path similar to Fleet Foxes, reaching back to the likes of Fairport Convention and adding in the odd touch of Beach Boys (see, for example, GawendaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Carl Wilson impression at the end of The Woods). While I had initially expected another poor-manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fleet Foxes imitation, I found myself drawn to much of Forever So. Beautiful little moments litter the record, instances that grab you and demand attention Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as how the finger-picked guitar gives way to the rich intonation of Gawenda during the opening stanzas of the impressive HistoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Door; the gentle Midlake-like vocal harmonies that drift through Hunter, and the compelling tale of frayed relationships that lurks beneath Dark Sea. HuskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories are certainly romanticised, but this type of music works best that way and Husky have the approach down pat. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all plain sailing though Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first half of the record is noticeably stronger than the second, the mood changing somewhere around the title track, the songs becoming more self-conscious and less charming. Tracks like the sympathetic How Do You Feel are not necessarily bad, but lack the immediacy of those that come before. Still, I expected to dislike Forever So, but ended up largely enjoying it. Meaning HuskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music may be powerful enough to win over the sceptics.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee273391a6e42d458eb7ca2f359495d9d348c742","amp;dn":"Husky...Forever+So%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee273391a6e42d458eb7ca2f359495d9d348c742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,39,51,145,166,228,45,69,142,183,202,47,53,148,149,217,211,72,199,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
