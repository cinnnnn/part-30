The measurement system presented here makes possible measurements at formerly inaccessible packaging interconnects. For the first time it becomes possible to describe the wire-bonding process window in terms of the physical forces at the contact zone instead of the applied machine settings. This is significant for a deeper understanding and future development of these packaging processes. Applications of the sensor in the field of wire bonding and flip-chip characterization are also illustrated. The reader will gain much insight into the important field of interconnection technology in semiconductor packaging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9fb32176236c8750916290fc0da18f17c8ce174","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2005%5D+Force+Sensors+for+Microelectronic+Packaging+Applica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9fb32176236c8750916290fc0da18f17c8ce174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,251,50,23,98,54,200,117,9,22,41,15,192,218,24,241,124,140,225,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
