Hock\n\n256 pages - Publisher: Routledge; 2 edition\nYear - 2006 - Language: English\nISBN-10: 0415953251 - ISBN-13: 978-0415953252\n\n\n\nThose who have never experienced an abusive or violent relationship often believe that upon finding a way out, victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ difficulties are solved: their life is good, they are safe, and recovery will be swift. However, survivors know that leaving is not the end of the nightmare -- it is the beginning of an often difficult and challenging journey toward healing and happiness. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Life Now offers readers the practical guidance, emotional reassurance, and psychological awareness that survivors of relationship abuse and domestic violence need to heal and reclaim their lives after leaving their abusers.\n\nSince its publication in 2000, It's My Life Now has been highly successful as a working manual for survivors who are starting their lives over after an abusive relationship. This valuable book combines direction on practical and emotional issues with worksheets and self-exploration exercises. Now, in the second edition, Dugan and Hock include updated information and resources while encompassing a wider range of individuals and the relationships in which abuse and violence occur. The new edition also provides a new emphasis on safety assessment, which has increasingly been shown to be a critical factor in recovery. In addition, this new edition includes current resources and information about organizations for victims along with revised and enhanced strategies to help survivors move forward on the path of recovery.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9577f34e76fb34dcd2ec2cca614f8df19c0c7f57","amp;dn":"It%27s+My+Life+Now+-+2nd+Edition+-+Pdf+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9577f34e76fb34dcd2ec2cca614f8df19c0c7f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,119,243,78,118,251,52,220,210,236,44,202,97,79,141,241,156,12,127,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
