Advancing past the first round will require a lot of hard work in just 20 minutes, including opening oysters and defrosting blocks of creamed spinach. A tropical fruit lightens things up in the entree basket. Then, with marshmallows in the dessert basket, s'mores come to mind for one of the last two chefs. Will the judges enjoy the campfire-inspired creation?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 05-Aug-2012 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:547c761c7b02315d83eaa7f37c804ee2d4b64498","amp;dn":"Chopped.S12E12.Grill.Masters.Part.Three.HDTV.XviD-pwe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"547c761c7b02315d83eaa7f37c804ee2d4b64498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,124,118,28,123,2,49,93,131,234,167,243,124,128,78,226,212,182,68,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
